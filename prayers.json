It gives greater understanding of the atonement wrought by the Savior of all mankind. </p><p>To Thee, dear Father, be the honor, and the praise and the glory, now and forever more, we pray in the name of Thy Divine Son, the Redeemer of the world, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>", 
    "boise": "<p>O God, our Eternal Father, Thou great everlasting Elohim, hallowed be Thy holy name.  In the sacred name of Thy Beloved Son, our Savior and Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, we come unto Thee in solemn prayer to dedicate this Thy holy house. </p><p>We lift our voices in thanksgiving for Thy marvelous blessings upon Thy people.  Surely Thou hast favored us in a remarkable and wonderful way.  We have been made partakers of Thine ancient covenant and become heirs to the great, eternal promises given of old.  Thou hast restored Thy work and Thine authority in this the dispensation of the fulness of times.  Ours is a day of prophecy fulfilled.  Beginning with Thy chosen servant Joseph Smith, to whom Thou didst reveal Thyself and Thy Beloved Son, Thou hast made Thy will known to Thine appointed prophets, adding line upon line and precept upon precept. </p><p>We thank Thee for Thy prophet in this day, even Thy chosen servant Spencer W. Kimball, and unite ourselves in prayer that he may be comforted and sustained and blessed of Thee.  We invoke Thy blessings upon those associated with him, and upon all who have responsibility in Thy kingdom wherever it may be established. </p><p>Bless Thy saints everywhere.  Strengthen them in their faith.  Look with favor upon all who walk honestly with Thee in the payment of their tithes and offerings.  Open the windows of heaven and pour Thy gifts upon them. </p><p>Father, the little stone which Thou didst cut out of the mountain without hands is rolling forth to fill the earth.  Guide and strengthen the messengers of truth.  Touch the hearts of the leaders of nations that Thy work may move forth over the earth, ever increasing in strength and vitality, touching for everlasting good the hearts of Thy sons and daughters in many nations and principalities. </p><p>We rejoice in Thy mercy, Father.  Through the power of the Holy Ghost we have been granted great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures, as Thou didst promise.  Give us the strength to walk in faith.  Forgive our sins and help us to live above our weaknesses.  May all who attend the dedicatory services of this temple be imbued with desire and resolution to walk more closely with Thee, to keep Thy commandments and observe Thy statutes, and so to conduct themselves as to be worthy of Thy favor. </p><p>Many not of our faith have heretofore visited this building.  May they reflect on their experience with reverence and appreciation. Confound the enemies of Thy work, Father.  Frustrate them in their evil designs.  May their efforts come to naught.  Touch them by Thy Spirit that they may see the error of their ways. </p><p>We thank Thee, Almighty God, for this choice land of America in which Thou didst deign to restore Thy gospel and reveal the ordinances of this house.  We thank Thee for the freedom vouchsafed under the Constitution of the United States which was written by inspired men whom Thou didst raise up unto this very purpose.  Wilt Thou move with power to safeguard these freedoms and may they spread over the earth that the shackles of oppression may be lifted from Thy children. </p><p>Now, our Beloved Father, in the authority of the holy priesthood in us vested, even the authority of the priesthood after the Order of the Son of God, we dedicate unto Thee and unto Thy Beloved Son this the Boise Idaho Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, together with the ground on which it stands, with the landscaping thereon, the buildings, all the parts thereof, and all of the furnishings and facilities appertaining thereto.  Wilt Thou accept this beautiful edifice as Thy house, the gift of Thy thankful children.  Wilt Thou hallow it.  Wilt Thou and Thy Son honor it with Thy presence, and may Thy Holy Spirit be felt here at all times by all who enter its portals. </p><p>We dedicate it for the sacred work Thou hast revealed for the blessing of Thy children, both the living and the dead.  May the ordinances which will be performed herein be received with thankful and reverent hearts, and may those beyond the veil of death rejoice because of the work done here in their behalf. </p><p>Bless all who shall officiate herein, the temple presidents and their counselors, those presently serving and those who will serve in the years to come.  Bless those vested with the sacred sealing authority, and all who are designated and called to serve in this hallowed edifice. </p><p>May it be a place of holiness to all who come here.  May no profane act occur herein.  May no unhallowed word be spoken.  May Thy faithful saints of this and future generations look to this beautiful structure as a house to which they will be made welcome for their washings and anointings, for endowments and sealings, for instruction, for meditation, for worship, for the making of eternal covenants with Thee, for inspiration and sanctification, as they serve unselfishly in assisting Thee in bringing to pass Thine eternal purposes for the salvation and exaltation of Thy sons and daughters. </p><p>Thou almighty God, we reverence Thy name and the name of Thy Son.  We love Thee, we worship Thee, we sing Thy praises and seek to do Thy will.  On this day of dedication, we consecrate ourselves anew to Thy holy service and ask for strength to walk after Thy pattern, in the name of Thine Only Begotten, through whose sacrifice comes our salvation, even the Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.</p>", 
    "boston": "<p>Almighty Father, Thou great Elohim who presides over the universe and sits in judgment on the nations, in humility and with solemn reverence we bow before Thee on this historic day.</p><p>We are assembled to dedicate this Thy holy house. It is a special occasion. This temple becomes the 100th operating temple of Thy Church.</p><p>We have looked forward to this occasion. We have prayed for this day. We extend our gratitude to all who have labored so faithfully and diligently, often in the face of serious opposition, to bring to pass the miracle of the completion of this temple.</p><p>To us it is indeed a miracle. The ground on which it stands, the circumstances of its preservation for this use, and the decision to build it here\u2014all are miracles unto those who have been a part of this process.</p><p>Now it is ready for the purposes for which it has been constructed. We are deeply grateful. We thank Thee for Thy marvelous and overruling actions which have made all of this possible.</p><p>And now, acting in the authority of the holy priesthood, even the fulness of the priesthood, and in the name of Thine Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, we dedicate unto Thee and unto Him this the Boston Massachusetts Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p>Dear Father, please accept it as the gift of our hearts and hands. We present it with love for Thee and for Thy precious Son. We pray that Thou wilt bless it with the presence of Thy Holy Spirit. May it ever be sacred unto Thy people. May even those not of our faith look upon it as a hallowed structure, and do so with respect. Save it from the hands of evil men. May neither the vandal nor the destroyer be inclined to damage it or deface it in any way.</p><p>O God, the Eternal Father, we acknowledge Thine intervening hand in holding back the adversary in his machinations to delay and stop the construction of this sacred house. Thy Church has prevailed in the courts, and we pray that it will yet prevail. We pray that those who have been bitterly opposed may experience a change of feeling. May their hearts be softened. Wilt Thou touch them by Thy Holy Spirit, that their animosity may turn to gratitude and that their fears may fade as they contemplate, according to their knowledge, the true significance of this House of the Lord.</p><p>We are grateful that so many have come to view it, and we pray that a remembrance of this experience may remain with them always, to soften their feelings and lead them in the direction of Thine eternal work for which this house has been designed.</p><p>The building has no steeple. We dedicate it as being complete, but pray that the way may be opened for the placement of a steeple with the crowning figure of Moroni, Thine ancient prophet.</p><p>Save this house, we pray, from the destructive forces of nature. May it stand against the storm, the wind and the rain, the frost of winter and the heat of summer.</p><p>We dedicate the building from the footings to the roof, the walls and the windows, the surrounding grounds, including their parking areas, the grass and the shrubs, the trees and the flowers.</p><p>We dedicate the beautiful Baptistry, the endowment rooms, the magnificent celestial room, the sealing rooms with their sacred altars, the halls, the offices, and every other facility and feature of this Thine abode. We consecrate it, and sing forth anthems of holiness to the Lord whose house this now is.</p><p>We pray that all who enter may do so with reverence and respect. We pray that they may here serve with love for Thee and with appreciation for Thy great plan for the eternal happiness of Thy children.</p><p>Bless the temple presidency, the matron and assistants to the matron, and all who will serve in administering the ordinances of Thy house and in carrying on its various activities.</p><p>We pray that Thy people in this temple district may make themselves worthy of every blessing to be found here. May they come, pure in heart and clean in hand, to the House of the Lord with gratitude in their hearts for the marvelous blessings to be gained here. May they be endowed with power from on high and be granted a knowledge of things sacred and divine. May the covenants which they make be binding upon them. Keep them always in the way they should walk. May they sense the wonders of the blessings of eternity to be gained here and here alone.</p><p>May nothing less than marriage in Thy holy house, under the authority of the everlasting priesthood, be acceptable unto Thy sons and daughters. May they never forget the sanctity nor hold lightly the importance of the marriage covenant here entered into.</p><p>We pray that the presence of this house may give impetus to the work of Thy people in seeking their kindred dead and doing for them that which they cannot do for themselves. May their work for those beyond the veil bring joy into the hearts of all who shall here serve as proxies in behalf of the deceased.</p><p>Now, Father, we thank Thee for this land in which we live and for the soil upon which this temple stands. In this area were enacted many of the historic events of the founding of our republic. As was spoken at Kirtland by the Prophet Joseph: \"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever\" (D&amp;C; 109:54). Bless Thy work in this nation and throughout the earth that it may grow and prosper, that none shall stay its progress, that the forces of evil shall fall before it, that righteousness may be its watch word, and faith its method. May it \"come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners\" (D&amp;C; 109:73).</p><p>Bless those who preside in Thy kingdom. May they walk acceptably before Thee, extending love and receiving it from Thy faithful Saints. Bless Thy people everywhere. Hear their prayers. Fortify their homes against the forces of evil. May their sons and daughters grow in righteousness and with faith in Thee. May they be honored and respected among their associates wherever they may find themselves. Bless them to be neighborly and kind, friendly and helpful. May love and peace dwell in the homes of Thy Saints. May they look to Thee and live.</p><p>Dear Father, we feel so deeply grateful on this sacred day. Accept of our love. Smile with favor upon us. Grant us that peace which passeth all understanding. Prosper us in our labors in righteousness. May we walk always in Thy light and in obedience to Thy will, we humbly pray in the name of Him who is our Redeemer, our Savior, and our Lord, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>", 
    "bountiful": "<p>O God, our Eternal Father, thou great Elohim, Creator of the heavens, the earth and all things thereon, we come before thee this sacred and blessed day with bowed heads, full hearts and subdued spirits.</p><p>We pray to thee, our Father, in the name of thy Beloved Son, thine Only Begotten, even our Redeemer and our Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord. We know that through obedience to thy divine commandments, we may return to thee and be blessed with life eternal in thy exalted presence.</p><p>We are grateful for this long-awaited day of dedication, when this, thy Holy House, has been completed. Bless, we pray thee, those faithful members here and throughout the world who have contributed their tithes which have made possible this magnificent edifice for thy name's honor and glory and for the blessing of all who enter herein. Let peace prevail as we lift our voices in songs of praise and words of prayer unto thee, our God.</p><p>We are thankful that thou sent thine Only Begotten Son to this earth to be its Savior, and the Prophet Joseph Smith to bring about the restoration, and that thou did appear to the Prophet in person to open the heavens and to restore to the world the knowledge of thee and thy Son and thy holy purposes.</p><p>The atonement wrought by thy Son gives purpose to our being and turns our thoughts heavenward. We thank thee that thou did reveal unto thy priesthood even the sacred sealing power, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, so that in this temple and all thy other holy houses, thy faithful Saints may be endowed with power from on high and may enter into those everlasting covenants which open the door to the receipt of all of the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the holy prophets. The Plan of Salvation taught in the temple with simplicity, yet with power, will be as a never-failing beacon of divine light to guide our footsteps and keep them constantly on the pathway of eternal life.</p><p>As we do the work in this temple for those who have gone beyond, we are reminded of the inspired counsel of President Joseph F. Smith who declared: \"Through our efforts in their behalf, their chains of bondage will fall from them, and the darkness surrounding them will clear away, that light may shine upon them; and they shall hear in the spirit world of the work that has been done for them by their children here, and will rejoice.\"</p><p>We seek to be like thee; we seek to pattern our lives after the life of thy Son; we desire righteousness for ourselves and our children and our children's children. We plead with thee to make us worthy to inherit the fullness of those blessings found only in thy holy temples\u2014even those blessings which grow out of a continuation of the family unit forever. We thank thee for the freedom we enjoy in this blessed land. Grant that the freedom emanating from the inspired Constitution, which provides us the opportunity to erect this holy temple, may be strengthened in other lands and open the way for more temples to dot the landscapes of countries throughout the world, that all thy worthy children may be blessed as we are here today.</p><p>Bless thy messengers of glory\u2014even the missionaries of thy Church\u2014that they may proclaim with persuasion and power thy truths. Protect them, watch over them, and lead them to those whom thou hast prepared to hear, to believe, and to embrace the Gospel of thy Beloved Son.</p><p>Father in Heaven bless, we pray thee, the President of the Church and his counselors who comprise the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Quorums of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric with thy guiding influence and inspiration.</p><p>Bless the temple president and his counselors, together with their wives, and all who will assist in the operation of this temple.</p><p>Bless thy children throughout the world who know hunger, who have no shelter and who face daily suffering. May we who have been blessed with abundance reach out in a spirit of love and true charity to those who yearn for our help.</p><p>In a time of departure from safe moorings, may youth of the noble birthright carry on in the traditions of their parents and grandparents. They are subjected to the sophistries of Satan. Help such youth to stand firm for truth. Open wide to their view the gates of learning, of understanding, of service in thy kingdom. Bless them with a lengthened view of their eternal possibilities.</p><p>Today when the family unit is under attack and things long held sacred are often ridiculed by the world, we seek thy help to make us equal to our tasks, that our homes may be havens of peace and happiness. In our families, may we pause to pray and think to thank.</p><p>We express our gratitude for all who have participated in the preparations for this day of dedication, as well as for those who made possible the highly successful open house event. We ask thy blessings to attend that vast throng who walked within these sacred walls and felt stirring thoughts course through their minds and hearts. May the spirit of the temple continue with them. And now, our Beloved Father, acting in the authority of the Holy Priesthood and in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate unto thee and unto thy Son this, the Bountiful Utah Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We dedicate it as a house of baptism, a house of endowment, a house of sealing, a house of righteousness, for the living and for the dead.</p><p>We humbly pray that thou wilt accept this edifice and let thy blessings be upon it. Let thy spirit attend and guide all who officiate herein, that holiness will prevail in every room. May all who enter have clean hands and pure hearts. May they be built up in their faith and depart with a feeling of peace, praising thy holy name. We dedicate the ground on which the temple stands, sensing it was reserved for this purpose. We dedicate the beautiful structure, from the unseen footings to the majestic figure of Moroni crowning its highest point. We dedicate the baptistry, all of the facilities for administering the sacred ordinances, the endowment rooms, the sealing rooms with their sacred altars, and the lovely celestial room, together with all ancillary facilities and the beautiful grounds with their lawns, flowers, trees, and shrubs. Protect all from any devastating influence, destruction, or defacement.</p><p>May this House provide a spirit of peace to all who observe its majesty, and especially to those who enter for their own sacred ordinances and to perform the work for their loved ones beyond the veil. Let them feel of thy divine love and mercy. May they be privileged to say, as did the Psalmist of old, \"We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.\"</p><p>As we dedicate this sacred edifice, we rededicate our very lives to thee and to thy work.</p><p>O, Holy Father, bless thy children everywhere with the peace promised by thy Son\u2014even the peace which passeth understanding. Shield us, we pray, from selfishness or sin and provide the power that we might rise above all that is sordid or below the dignity of thy children.</p><p>And now we dedicate this temple as an abode for thee and thy Son. Let thy glorious light ever shine upon it. Wilt thou place thy ratifying seal of approval upon this dedicatory service and upon all we have done and shall do in this, thy Holy House, which we now present to thee.</p><p>May we, thy children, merit thy bounteous blessings and thy watchful care, we pray, in the name of thy Beloved Son, even the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord, Amen.</p>",

Keep it safe from any who may seek to deface or defile it in any way. </p><p>We honor the memory of those who came to this valley as pioneers and have raised their families to honor the order of the principles and ordinances of the gospel. When they first came, this was an untamed wilderness. Now we see the homes and the gardens and the communities which they have built. </p><p>We know that the family is a sacred institution and that in this temple a man and a woman may be sealed for time and all eternity. May those who are so sealed honor the covenants they make to find true, everlasting happiness and joy in their posterity.</p><p>We sense the presence today of Presidents Brigham Young and Lorenzo Snow and Elder Rudger Clawson, each of whom would be very interested in the dedication of this temple.</p><p>Bless those who will serve as president and matron of the temple with all who attend them. May Thy Spirit rest upon all who enter Thy house that they may feel of Thy power and acceptance of their offerings. Bless any who seek peace and understanding to find them in this place of holiness. </p><p>We invoke Thy blessings upon the stately Brigham City Tabernacle which for generations has stood as a beacon for this community.</p><p>We seek Thy favor, Father, in pouring out Thy blessings upon all those who reside in the Brigham City Utah Temple District and in the surrounding communities. Prosper them as they honor this Thy house. Strengthen their resolve to stand firm in their knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Shower down Thy blessings upon those who are faithful. Forbid the adversary from having power and influence over them. Rebuke the devourer and he who seeks to disrupt and destroy. </p><p>Bless the children and youth in a world that is increasingly unworthy. Show them a pattern of living that will keep this Thy holy people close to Thee.</p><p>We pray for people everywhere, Father. May they be a covenant-keeping people and enjoy the fruits of happiness and joy that come from righteous living. </p><p>We pray for Thy servants who are called to stand as witnesses. May they speak with power and authority from on high. Let those who hear their witness know that they speak by the power of God.</p><p>Cause Thy kingdom, Father, to roll forth.

We dedicate the structure from the footing to the figure of Moroni, the walls, the windows, and all of the features of this marvelous edifice.</p><p>We dedicate the beautiful baptismal font representative of the molten sea of Solomon's temple. May this font be sacred to all who shall enter its waters, here to be immersed in behalf of those beyond the veil of death.

    "chicago": "<p>Almighty God of our fathers, our own beloved Father in heaven, Thou great Elohim, we come unto Thee in prayer in the name of Thy Beloved Son Jesus Christ.</p><p>We are met in Thy holy house, erected on the soil of Illinois, to dedicate unto Thee Thy temple.  One hundred and thirty-nine years ago our forebears fled this area, leaving behind the temple which they had just constructed.  As they moved west across the Iowa prairie their last lingering look was at the tower of that holy edifice which had come with tremendous cost and out of unwavering faith and devotion.</p><p>On this day, in this new and beautiful Chicago temple, we of this generation remember Nauvoo.  We think of the sacred edifice which stood high on its hill.  We remember with appreciation and gratitude those who built it.  We recall their sacrifice when they were driven from it.  Knowing they soon would be banished, and with many of their number already gone, they yet chose to complete it and dedicate it unto Thee.</p><p>O God, we thank Thee for the inheritance of faith that has come down from that generation.  We thank Thee for a new and better day when our people have returned to this area, and large numbers have been added to Thy Church in this part of the nation.</p><p>We are reminded also that Thy first house built in this dispensation was constructed at Kirtland, Ohio.  When that sacred edifice was dedicated Thy prophet, Joseph Smith, received through revelation from Thee the dedicatory prayer which included this plea:</p><p>\"Remember all Thy church, O Lord, with all their families\u2026that the kingdom, which Thou hast set up without hands, may become a great mountain and fill the whole earth;</p><p>\"That Thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners;</p><p>\"And be adorned as a bride for that day when Thou shalt unveil the heavens...that Thy glory may fill the earth.\"</p><p>Heavenly Father, we see the dawning of that glorious day.  The morning breaks, and the sunlight of truth is spreading over the earth.  Thy people, once few in number, have become a great multitude, living in many lands and speaking many tongues.  Their numbers are constantly increasing.  The virtue of their lives is widely acclaimed.  We are profoundly grateful for Thy blessings upon Thy work and upon Thy faithful saints across the earth.</p><p>We thank Thee now for this glorious day and for all who have labored to make it possible.  We thank Thee for the generation of the faithful who have preceded us.  We thank Thee for Thy devoted saints wherever they may be who have contributed of their tithes and offerings, which, together with the generous contributions of those in this temple district, have brought to fruition this glorious undertaking.</p><p>We praise Thy holy name, our Father and our God.  We praise the name of Thy Beloved Son, our Savior and our Redeemer.  In the authority of the holy priesthood which Thou hast restored to the earth, and which thou hast conferred upon us, we dedicate unto Thee and unto Him this, the Chicago Illinois Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  We dedicate it as Thy holy house with a prayer that Thou wilt accept it as the offering of Thy thankful children.  We dedicate it for the transcendent purposes which Thou hast revealed in this dispensation for the blessing of Thy sons and daughters of all generations.</p><p>We dedicate the ground on which it stands, with the flowers, the trees, and the shrubs which adorn it.  We dedicate the structure from the footings to the top of the tallest steeple.  We dedicate all of the rooms, the sacred altars, the fixtures, the furniture, the fittings, and all which have been assembled together to make of this a beautiful structure, holy and sacred to us as the house of the Lord.</p><p>Almighty God, wilt Thou hallow it and sanctify it.  May Thy presence be felt here, and may Thy Holy Spirit abide constantly within its walls.  May all who enter feel of that Spirit and know that they are in holy precincts.  May it be a place of refuge from the cares of the world, a house of peace and love.  May its rooms and halls be hallowed to those who shall walk here.  May faith increase in the hearts of all who come, and may knowledge of Thine eternal plan grow in the minds of those who here serve, be they workers, or patrons.  May gratitude well up in the hearts of Thy faithful saints throughout the earth, and may the dead beyond the veil rejoice over what will here be accomplished to their eternal blessing.</p><p>We unite in prayer in behalf of Thy prophet Spencer W. Kimball who suffers from the infirmities of age.  Extend his life in comfort and dignity.  Bless those associated with him in the First Presidency of Thy Church.  Bless the Council of the Twelve Apostles, the Seventy, and the Bishopric.  We pray for all throughout the world who have responsibility for the advancement of Thy work.  We pray for Thy people everywhere.  May Thy peace dwell in their hearts and homes.  May they be blessed in their basket and in their store as they walk honestly with Thee.  May their children grow in righteousness and faith that their lives may be enriched and that Thy kingdom may become ever stronger.</p><p>Beloved Father, may Thy watchcare be over this holy house.  Protect it by Thy power from the destructive forces of nature and the vile impulses of men.  May it stand without molestation and may those who mock its sacred ordinances feel the weight of Thy censuring hand upon them.</p><p>We are mindful that Thy prophet Joseph, and his brother Hyrum, were martyred in Carthage and were buried in Nauvoo, Illinois, at a time of terrible conflict and persecution.  May there now be peace and goodwill in the land.  Bless the officers of this state and nation that they shall stand firmly for those principles of freedom and equity which were written into the Constitution of the United States under Thine inspiration.</p><p>May this holy house, built in peace and dedicated in faith, stand as a testimony that the oppression of the past has faded and that Thy people today enjoy the precious blessings of worshipping Thee according to Thy revelations without fear or molestation.  May Thy work move forward to the encompassing glory Thou hast set for it, we humbly pray, as in faith we rededicate ourselves to Thy service, with songs of thanksgiving and praise, in the name of Thy Beloved Son, the Prince of Life, our gracious and generous Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.</p>",

Most emigrated to their Zion in the early seasons of this work. Now Thy people are urged to remain and build Zion in this good land. That they might have every blessing, and that they might extend these blessings to those beyond the veil of death, this beautiful temple has been constructed in their midst. An historic building, dedicated in 1931, has been almost totally modified to become a sacred temple, the house of the Lord.

Protect it by Thy power, we pray Thee. Preserve it from the storms of nature and from the evil hand of the vandal or any who might desire to desecrate it. Touch the hearts of all who serve herein with an understanding of Thy divine purposes and of Thy glorious work in bringing \"to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\" (Moses 1:39).</p><p>We pray for the temple president and his counselors, for the matron and her assistants. We pray for all who will serve within these sacred walls, whether they be officiators or patrons.</p><p>Bless those who are baptized in behalf of the dead, that this may be a sanctifying experience for each.

The Atonement wrought by Thy Son gives purpose to our being and turns our thoughts heavenward.</p><p>We thank Thee for the Prophet Joseph Smith and for the Restoration, and that Thou did appear to him in person to open the heavens and to restore to the world the knowledge of Thee and Thy Son and Thy holy purposes.</p><p>We thank Thee that Thou did reveal unto Thy priesthood even the sacred sealing power, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, so that in this temple and all Thy other holy houses Thy faithful Saints may be endowed with power from on high and may enter into those everlasting covenants which open the door to the receipt of all of the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the holy prophets.</p><p>The Plan of Salvation taught in the temple with simplicity, yet with power, will be as a never-failing beacon of divine light to guide our footsteps and keep them constantly on the pathway of eternal life.</p><p>As we do the work in this temple for those who have gone beyond, we are reminded of the inspired counsel of President Joseph F. Smith who declared:  \"Through our efforts in their behalf, their chains of bondage will fall from them, and the darkness surrounding them will clear away, that light may shine upon them; and they shall hear in the spirit world of the work that has been done for them by their children here, and will rejoice.\"</p><p>We seek to be like Thee; we seek to pattern our lives after the life of Thy Son; we desire righteousness for ourselves and our children and our children's children. We plead with Thee to make us worthy to inherit the fulness of those blessings found only in Thy holy temples\u2014even those blessings which grow out of a continuation of the family unit forever.</p><p>Bless Thy messengers of glory\u2014even the missionaries of Thy Church\u2014that they may proclaim with persuasion and power Thy truths. Protect them, watch over them, and lead them to those whom Thou hast prepared to hear, to believe, and to embrace the Gospel of Thy Beloved Son.</p><p>Father in Heaven bless, we pray Thee, those called to lead Thy Church here upon the earth, that they may have Thy guiding influence and inspiration.</p><p>Bless the temple president and his counselors, together with their wives, and all who will assist in the operation of this temple. Bless Thy children throughout the world who know hunger, who have no shelter and who face daily suffering. May we reach out in a spirit of love and true charity to those who yearn for our help.</p><p>In a time of departure from safe moorings, may youth of the noble birthright carry on in the traditions of their parents and grandparents. They are subjected to the sophistries of Satan. Help such youth to stand firm for truth and righteousness. Open wide to their view the gates of learning, of understanding, of service in Thy kingdom. Bless them with a lengthened view of their eternal possibilities.</p><p>Today when the family unit is under attack and things long held sacred are often ridiculed by the world, we seek Thy help to make us equal to our tasks, that our homes may be havens of peace and happiness. In our families, may we pause to pray and think to thank.</p><p>We express our gratitude for all who have participated in the preparations for this day of dedication, as well as for those who made possible the highly successful open house event. We ask Thy blessings to attend that vast throng who walked within these sacred walls and felt stirring thoughts course through their minds and hearts. May the spirit of the temple continue with them.</p><p>And now, our Beloved Father, acting in the authority of the Holy Priesthood and in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate unto Thee and unto Thy Son this, the Draper Utah Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We dedicate it as a house of baptism, a house of endowment, a house of sealing and a house of righteousness, both for the living and for the dead.</p><p>We humbly pray that Thou wilt accept this edifice and let Thy blessings be upon it. Let Thy spirit attend and guide all who officiate herein, that holiness will prevail in every room. May all who enter have clean hands and pure hearts. May they be built up in their faith and depart with a feeling of peace, praising Thy holy name.</p><p>We dedicate the ground on which the temple stands. We dedicate the beautiful structure, from the unseen footings to the majestic figure of Moroni crowning its highest point. We dedicate the baptistry, all of the facilities for administering the sacred ordinances, the endowment rooms, the sealing rooms with their sacred altars, and the lovely celestial room, together with all ancillary facilities and the beautiful grounds with their lawns, flowers, trees and shrubs. Protect all from any devastating influence, destruction or defacement.</p><p>May this House provide a spirit of peace to all who observe its majesty, and especially to those who enter for their own sacred ordinances and to perform the work for those beyond the veil. Let them feel of Thy divine love and mercy. May they be privileged to say, as did the Psalmist of old, \"We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.\"</p><p>As we dedicate this sacred edifice, we rededicate our very lives to Thee and to Thy work.</p><p>O, Holy Father, bless us with the peace promised by Thy Son\u2014even the peace which passeth understanding. Shield us, we pray, from selfishness or sin and provide the power that we might rise above all that is sordid or below the dignity of Thy children.</p><p>And now we dedicate this temple as an abode for Thee and Thy Son. Let Thy glorious light ever shine upon it. Wilt Thou place Thy ratifying seal of approval upon this dedicatory service and upon all we have done and shall do in this, Thy Holy House, which we now present to Thee.</p><p>May we, Thy children, merit Thy bounteous blessings and Thy watchful care, we pray, in the name of Thy Beloved Son, even the name of Jesus Christ the Lord, Amen.</p>",

Help us, we pray Thee, to become even more susceptible in our spiritual response to Thee. </p><p>Bless the Presidencies of Stakes, High Councils, the Presidencies of Missions, Bishoprics of Wards, Presidencies of Branches and of Quorums, Superintendencies and Presidencies of Auxiliary Associations throughout the world\u2014make them keenly aware of the fact that they are trusted leaders and that they are to hold sacred that trust as they treasure their lives. </p><p>We are grateful that the members of the Church recognize that the payment of tithes and offerings brings blessings, and makes possible the proclamation of the gospel to the ends of the world, and contributes to the carrying out of Thy purposes through the building of chapels, tabernacles, and eventually temples wherever the Churches are organized in all lands and climes. </p><p>O Father, we sense that the crying need of the world today is acceptance of Jesus Christ and His gospel to counteract false teachings which now disturb the peace of honest men and women, and which undermine the faith of millions whose belief in Thee has been faltering and unstable because they have not yet had presented to them the eternal plan of salvation. </p><p>Guide us, O God, in our efforts to hasten the day when humanity will renounce contention and strife, when \"nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\" </p><p>To this end bless the leaders of nations that their hearts may be cleared of prejudices, suspicion, and avarice, and filled with a desire for peace and righteousness. </p><p>As one means of uniting Thy children in the bonds of peace and love, this Temple and other holy houses of the Lord are erected in Thy name. </p><p>Help Thy people to realize that only by obedience to the eternal principles and ordinances of the Gospel may loved ones who died without baptism be permitted the glorious privilege of entrance into the Kingdom of God.  Increase our desire, O Father, to put forth even greater effort toward the consummation of Thy purpose to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of all Thy children.  This edifice is one more means to aid in bringing about this divine consummation. </p><p>To this end, by the authority of the Holy Priesthood, we dedicate this New Zealand Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and consecrate it for the purposes for which it has been erected. </p><p>We dedicate it unto Thee, with all pertaining thereto as a House of Prayer, a House of Praise, a House of Worship, a House of Inspiration and communion with Thee. </p><p>We pray Thee, Heavenly Father, to accept this building in all its parts, from the foundation to turret; the Assembly Rooms, the Sealing Rooms, the Altars, and all the multitudinous appliances and appurtenances found in and belonging to this Temple and its annexes. </p><p>We dedicate the grounds upon which the Temple stands, and by which it is surrounded; the walks, ornamental beds, the trees, plants, flowers, and shrubbery that grow in the soil; may they bloom and blossom and become exceedingly beautiful and fragrant, and may Thy spirit dwell in the midst thereof that this plot of ground may be a place of rest and peace for holy meditation and inspired thought. </p><p>Preserve these buildings, we beseech Thee, from destruction by flood or fire; from the rage of elements, the shafts of the vivid lightning, the overwhelming blasts of the hurricane, and the upheavals of earthquake, O, Lord, protect them. </p><p>We invoke Thy blessing particularly upon the men and women who have so willingly and generously contributed their means, time, and effort to the completion of this imposing and impressive structure.  Especially we mention all those who have accepted calls as Labor Missionaries and literally consecrated their all upon the altar of service.  May each contributor be comforted in spirit and prospered many fold.  May they be assured that they have the gratitude of thousands, perhaps millions, on the Other Side for whom the prison doors may now be opened and deliverance proclaimed to those who will accept the truth and be set free. </p><p>Bless the President of the Temple and his wife as Matron.  Let humility temper their feelings; wisdom, and kind consideration guide their actions.  May they, and others, who will be appointed as assistants and custodians, maintain an atmosphere of cleanliness and holiness in every room.  Let no unclean person or thing ever enter herein, for \"my spirit,\" saith the Lord, \"will not dwell in unclean tabernacles\"; neither will it remain in a house where selfish, arrogant, or unwholesome thoughts abide.  Therefore may all who seek this Holy Temple come with clean hands and pure hearts that Thy Holy Spirit may ever be present to comfort, to inspire, and to bless.  If any with gloomy forebodings or heavy hearts enter, may they depart with their burdens lightened and their faith increased; if any have envy or bitterness in their hearts, may such feelings be replaced by self-searching and forgiveness.  May all who come within these sacred walls feel a peaceful, hallowed influence.  Cause, O Lord, that even people who pass the grounds, or view the Temple from afar, may lift their eyes from groveling things of sordid life and look up to Thee and Thy providence. </p><p>Now, dear Lord, our Eternal Father, through love for Thee and their fellow men, faithful members of Thy Church, and others who believe in Thee, by tithes and other generous contributions, have made possible the erection and completion of this, Thy holy House, in which will be performed the ordinances and ceremonies essential to the happiness, salvation, and exaltation of Thy children living in mortality and in the spirit world. Accept of our offering, hallow it by Thy Presence, protect it by Thy power. With this prayer we dedicate our lives to the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth for the peace of the world and to Thy Glory forever, in the name of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>",

We pray that Thou wilt hasten the day when righteousness shall cover the earth as the waters cover the mighty deep, and all men walk in Thy paths and delight to do Thy holy will.</p><p>We thank Thee for the various offices in Thy Holy Priesthood, for High Priests, Seventies, Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons. Wilt Thou inspire these, in whatsoever office to which they may be called, to function to the everlasting benefit of all to whom they may minister. We pray that Thou wilt bless Zion with all of her interests, in all her Stakes, Wards and Branches. May her borders be extended until Zion shall be fully redeemed and her inhabitants glorify Thy holy name.</p><p>Confer upon Thy people, and especially upon Thy leaders, in all of their various callings, Thy precious gifts of love, wisdom and judgment, knowledge and understanding, faith and the spirit of testimony, light, intelligence and capacity, and every attribute, blessing, gift and qualification either necessary or desirable for them to have and to enjoy in order that Thy great and important work may go forward to consummate its glorious purpose. Father, wilt Thou preserve Thy saints in the unity of the faith, in the way of truth, in the bonds of peace, and holiness of life. We pray that the weak may be strengthened and Thy Holy Spirit be imparted to all.</p><p>We pray for the youth everywhere, and all organizations calculated to develop their character and spirituality, and all which Thou hast caused to be established for their blessing and instruction, including the Primary Association, Sunday Schools, Young Men's and Young Women's Mutual Improvement Associations, the Church educational system, including the seminaries and institutes, and all the quorums of the Priesthood that have to do with the teaching and instruction of the youth. May Thy Holy Spirit be richly imparted to Thy young sons and daughters, that their faith may be enlarged, that they may walk righteously and circumspectly before Thee. We seek Thy blessings for all those who in any way devote their time in teaching the youth of Zion, that they may exercise great wisdom and judgment. May they be inspired in their guidance of Thy precious little ones to lead them into paths of truth and righteousness, that thereby the youth may lay a foundation upon which to establish righteous character and become useful in developing Thy Church and Kingdom in the earth.</p><p>We pray for the daughters of Zion. May they be preserved in virtue, chastity and purity of life, be blessed with vigorous bodies and minds, and with great faith. May they develop into true womanhood and receive choice companions under the new and everlasting covenant for time and for all eternity in Thy temples provided for this priceless privilege and purpose. May they too be privileged to enjoy as the fruits of their union a noble posterity which, we pray Thee, may be taught at their mother's knee to believe in Thee and in the divine mission of Thy Beloved Son.</p><p>We thank Thee, O our Father, that Thou didst restore that grand and glorious principle of marriage for eternity, and didst bestow upon Thy servant the power to seal on earth and have it recognized in the heavens. We acknowledge this privilege as one of Thy most marvelous gifts to us. May all the youth of Thy Church come to know of its beauty and of its eternal importance to them, and to take advantage of it when they marry. May they, our Father, on the other hand, realize fully that the glorious opportunity for eternal companionship of husband and wife, and the power of eternal increase, may be forfeited by them if they fail, through negliglence or indifference, to conform to Thy requirements, or if having taken advantage thereof, they may still through improper conduct lose their blessings.</p><p>Wilt Thou, O Father in heaven, remember the Relief Society throughout the length and breadth of the Church. May those who engage therein, either as officers or teachers, be abundantly rewarded for their unselfish sacrifices, for the services they render, for their acts of mercy and kindness, and for their ministrations to the sick, the needy, and the unfortunate. We pray Thee that in their homes and in their responsibilities they may enjoy the rich companionship of Thy Holy Spirit.</p><p>Thou, O Father, hast commanded mankind to subdue the earth, and also to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. Nevertheless there are those among us who because of misfortune that overtakes them are not able to keep fully these great commandments at all times. We are most grateful unto Thee that Thou didst inspire Thy servants to institute the Welfare Program of the Church through which it is made possible that the poor and unfortunate might be provided for without the forfeiture of self-respect. May Thy servants continue in Thy favor that they may thereby merit Thy inspiration in developing the Welfare Program until it becomes perfect in all respects to the care and blessing of Thy people.</p><p>Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. With deep gratitude in our hearts we thank Thee that the nations have ceased their warfare and the destruction of human life. We thank Thee that peace temporarily is established in the earth. We do pray that all people everywhere will now take cognizance of the horrors of war, and repent of their sins and follies and with contrite spirits turn unto Thee, the God of love and peace; that they may be inclined to follow the admonitions of Thy servants that thereby the peace now enjoyed by them may be made permanent, and the day of the coming of Thy Beloved Son hastened. We do most fervently pray that hate may lose its place in the hearts of men and that Thy peace and love may enter and abide therein. We also pray that Thy sons and daughters who have been required to participate in the great conflict to preserve liberty, may return to their homes and engage in wholesome and useful pursuits, and contribute to the building up of Thy Kingdom in the earth. May they whose release from the armed services, for any reason, may be delayed, be abundantly blessed of Thee and comforted, and be preserved in health and strength and righteousness, and may the day of their union with loved ones at home come as speedily as possible.</p><p>Wilt Thou, O Lord, have remembrance the promises made by Thee to Judah in his stricken and scattered condition. Hasten the time when he shall be restored to the land of his inheritance. Remove from him Thy displeasure, and may the days of his tribulation soon cease, and Jerusalem rejoice and Judah be made glad for the multitude of her sons and daughters, for the sweet voices of children in her streets, and for the manifold blessings Thou wilt pour out upon them.</p><p>Remember, O Lord, Thy promises to Israel, whom Thou didst cause to be taken captive and scattered among the heathen and to be dispersed throughout all countries, that Thou wouldst again gather them from among the nations whither they had been scattered. Wilt Thou, O gracious Father, in Thy wisdom and mercy, speedily fulfill Thy promises unto Israel and cause that they may again be gathered and hearken unto the voice of Thy servants, the prophets, and thereby merit the rich blessings Thou hast promised them when they acknowledge Jesus Christ, Thy Beloved Son, as their Redeemer.</p><p>O Father, remember Thy promises made unto Thy holy prophets regarding the remnants of those whom Thou didst lead unto this western hemisphere, that they should not be utterly destroyed but that a remnant should be preserved which would turn from their wickedness, repent of their sins, and eventually become a white and delightsome people. May the day speedily come when those promises will be fulfilled.</p><p>We thank Thee, O God, for the choice land upon which we reside, and for the marvelous promises Thou hast made concerning America, that it should be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under Heaven so long as the inhabitants of the land should worship the God of the land who is Jesus Christ. Thou hast revealed unto us that in the great controversy which took place in Heaven that the cornerstone of Thy plan of salvation was the free agency of man, and that Lucifer, who was an angel in authority in Thy Holy presence, proposed a different way; that Lucifer's plan was rejected because the effect of its application would be to deprive Thy children of their free agency. When Lucifer's plan was rejected by Thee he rebelled against Thee; there was war in Heaven and he and his followers were cast out. We thank Thee that Thou hast warned us by revelation that Satan would deceive the nations in our time. Thou hast said: \"I will give you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived, for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.\" As we look about in the world among the various countries we find philosophies and forms of government the effect of which is to deprive men of their free agency, but by reason of Thy timely warning to us, we know that they are not approved of Thee. Since the God of this choice land is Jesus Christ, we know that His philosophy of free agency should prevail here. Thou didst amply demonstrate this great principle to us by raising up wise men for the very purpose of giving us our Constitutional form of government, concerning which Thou hast said: \"I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another. And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up into this very purpose.\" There are those, our Heavenly Father, both within and without our borders who would destroy the Constitutional form of government which Thou hast so magnanimously given us, and would replace it with a form that would curtail if not altogether deprive man of his free agency. We pray Thee, therefore, that in all these matters Thou wilt help us to conform our lives to Thy desires, and that Thou wilt sustain us in our resolve so to do. We pray Thee that Thou wilt inspire good and just men everywhere to be willing to sacrifice for, support and uphold the Constitution and the government set up under it and thereby preserve for man his agency.</p><p>We thank Thee that Thou hast revealed to us that those who gave us our Constitutional form of government were men wise in Thy sight and that Thou didst raise them up for the very purpose of putting forth that sacred document.</p><p>Wilt Thou, O our Father, bless the Chief Executive of this land that his heart and will may be to preserve for us and our posterity the free institutions Thy Constitution has provided. Wilt Thou too bless the Legislative and Judicial branches of our government as well as the Executive, that all may function fully and courageously in their respective branches completely independent of each other to the preservation of our Constitutional form of government forever.</p><p>We pray that kings and rulers and the peoples of all nations under heaven may be persuaded of the blessings enjoyed by the people of this land by reason of their freedom under Thy guidance and be constrained to adopt similar governmental systems, thus to fulfill the ancient prophecy of Isaiah that \"out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\"</p><p>We pray that the barriers which have blocked the pathway to the preaching of the Gospel to the inhabitants of many of the nations may be broken down or swept aside so that Thy servants, the missionaries, may carry the gospel of peace and good will to the honest in heart in every nation under heaven.</p><p>Our hearts are filled with gratitude towards Thee, O God our Eternal Father, that Thou didst cause Thy Spirit to move upon our forebears and inspire them to come to this goodly land, declared by Thee to be choice above all other lands, where they might worship Thee untrammeled; that Thou didst promise, \"The wilderness and solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing . . . And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water.\" For the fertility of this land which, once most undesirable and forbidding, now produces in rich abundance delicious grain, fruits and vegetables, we are most grateful. We too express to Thee our joy in beholding great mountains towering majestically toward the sky to inspire Thy children to look up as well as around them that they might enjoy Thy handiwork.</p><p>We thank Thee, O God, for sending Elijah, the ancient prophet, to whom was \"committed the keys of power of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, that the whole earth may not be smitten with a curse.\" We thank Thee that he was sent to Thy servant Joseph Smith, to confer the keys of authority of the work for the dead, and to reveal that the plan of salvation embraces the whole of the human family; that the gospel is universal in scope, and that Thou art no respector of persons, having provided for the preaching of the gospel of salvation to both the living and the dead. We are most grateful unto Thee that salvation is provided for all who desire to be saved in Thy kingdom. May it be pleasing to Thy people to search out the genealogy of their forebears that they may become saviors on Mt. Zion by officiating in Thy temples for their kindred dead. We pray also that the spirit of Elijah may rest mightily upon all peoples everywhere that they may be moved upon to gather and make available the genealogy of their ancestors; and that Thy faithful children may utilize Thy holy temples in which to perform on behalf of the dead all ordinances pertaining to their eternal exaltation.</p><p>Bless all those who shall be workers in this Temple, whether they be officers, ordinance workers or caretakers. May they fulfill the functions of their respective callings in accordance with the spirit and purpose of it. May all ordinances to be performed in this House, including baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings, sealings, endowments, and all that is done, be acceptable unto Thee. Bless, we pray Thee, those who make and copy records that their work may be accurate and acceptable unto Thee; and also those who have labored in the erection of this Thy Holy House, or who have contributed of their means or time toward its completion. May their reward be sure and their joy complete.</p><p>We are grateful, Heavenly Father, that we have been permitted to rear this Temple on this beautiful spot upon the bank of one of Thy majestic rivers, the waters of which have made it possible for Thy faithful Saints residing here to subdue the land and establish delightful homes. We thank Thee for the means that Thou hast placed in our hands that has been utilized in constructing this edifice and preparing it for holy purposes.</p><p>We now present ourselves before Thee in humble gratitude and with hearts filled with praise and thanksgiving that Thou hast seen fit to permit us to complete this sacred building, which is now finished and ready to be dedicated to Thee and to Thy most holy name. And today we here and now dedicate this Temple unto Thee with all that pertains unto it that it may be holy in Thy sight; that it may be a house of prayer, a house of praise and of worship, that Thy glory may rest upon it and Thy holy presence be continually in it; and that it may be an acceptable abode for Thy Well-Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior; that it may be both sanctified and consecrated in all its parts sacred unto Thee. And we pray that all those who may cross the threshold of this Thine House may be impressed with the holiness of it, and deport themselves herein with righteous conduct, and may no uncleanliness ever pass its portals.</p><p>We pray now that Thou wilt accept this Temple as a freewill offering from Thy children, that it will be sacred unto Thee. We pray that all that has been accomplished here may be pleasing in Thy sight and that Thou wilt be mindful of this structure at all times that it may be preserved from the fury of the elements and wilt Thou, our Heavenly Father, let Thy presence be felt here always, that all who assemble here may realize that they are Thy guests and that this is Thy House.</p><p>In the authority of Thy Holy Priesthood, we dedicate unto Thee these grounds, this building in all its parts, from foundation to capstone, together with all that appertains thereunto, including furnishings and equipment and all facilities, and we pray that accepting this our offering Thou wilt preserve the same from decay and the ravages of time. We now present this precious Temple unto Thee, Holy Father, with all that pertains to it, inside and out, with our love and gratitude, and pray that Thou wilt accept of our offering, and unto Thee we ascribe all honor, glory and praise forever through Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>",

Above all, thou hast blessed us with the truths of thine everlasting gospel and the authority of thine eternal priesthood.</p><p>We thank thee for the Prophet Joseph Smith, an instrument in thy hand in bringing to pass this great work of restoration in preparation for the time when thy Son shall come to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords.</p><p>We thank thee for this beautiful temple, this house of worship, of learning, of covenants and everlasting promises. We thank thee for the faith and skills of all who have contributed to make it possible. It stands in this community which has become an oasis in the desert. As men have brought water to the dry earth of this region it has become fruitful, and now as a crowning jewel stands thy holy house with its surrounding lawns of green, its beds of colorful flowers, and the trees and shrubs which enhance its beauty.</p><p>Within its walls are to be tasted the refreshing waters of living and eternal truth. For all who enter the portals of thy house may this be an oasis of peace and life and light, in contrast with the clamor and evil and darkness of the world.</p><p>It stands where it will be seen by multitudes of the generations of men. May all who look upon it regard it reverently as the house of the Lord. May the hand of the destroyer be kept from it by thy power.</p><p>We are mindful of thy promise given in the early days of the Church that \"inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it;</p><p>\"Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God\" (D&amp;C; 97:15-16).</p><p>We plead for forgiveness and strength to overcome our weaknesses. We long for the day when we may be worthy to look upon thy face. Keep us from the decay and servitude which come from sin. Bless us with the light and freedom which come of righteousness.</p><p>Thy house is now complete. It is beautiful, and we present it as the gift of thy thankful children.</p><p>And now, acting in the authority of the holy priesthood which comes from thee, and in the name of Jesus Christ thy Son, we dedicate unto thee and our Savior this, the Las Vegas Nevada Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We dedicate it as thy holy house. We pray that thy Spirit may fill this sacred structure and that thy influence may hover over it by day and by night. We pray that thou might hallow it by thy presence.</p><p>We dedicate unto thee the grounds on which it stands with their vegetation and all of the ancillary construction associated therewith. We dedicate the sacred rooms, each one, with its associated fittings and furnishings. We dedicate the baptistry, the endowment rooms where thy people will enter into covenant with thee, the sacred altars and the sealing rooms where eternal promises will be made and accepted, and every other facility within this beautiful structure. May it be hallowed to all who enter. May their thoughts be lifted to thee and thy Beloved Son. May a spirit of peace and reconciliation be in their hearts. In the great work that will be performed here, everlasting in its consequences, may thy people find satisfaction and gladness.</p><p>O Father, look with favor upon thy sons and daughters wherever they may be. When they err, and come unto thee in repentance, wilt thou forgive and remember their sins no more. Give them grateful hearts for the blessings which thou hast showered upon them. Grant unto them strength to walk the straight and narrow way that leads to life eternal. May the people of thy Church across the world become a great and singular community, united by the bonds of the everlasting gospel, with love and respect one for another, with faith and knowledge of thee and thine eternal purposes, with obedience to thy commandments and that happiness which thou hast promised to those who walk acceptably before thee.</p><p>We pray for thy prophet of this day, even President Ezra Taft Benson. Give him strength of body and mind according to his need. Give him joy in his heart concerning thy work and thy people. Bless those associated with him among the General Authorities and officers of the Church. Bless all who hold responsibility of any kind in thy Church and kingdom wherever it may be organized. Pour out thy spirit upon thy faithful saints everywhere.</p><p>Touch the hearts of the people of the nations that they may receive the testimony of thy servants the missionaries. And bless these, thy dedicated servants, that they may be powerful in their teaching of divine truth and in their testimony of thy Beloved Son.</p><p>Bless the homes of thy people. May there be peace and harmony and love. May thy people look to thee and live.</p><p>Father dear, we remember before thee the suffering and needful of the earth. There are so many who struggle and yearn. There are so many in the depths of sorrow and pain, of hunger and want, of darkness and sin. Let thy spirit brood over the earth and lead thy sons and daughters of all lands that they may drink of the waters of divine truth.</p><p>We so invoke thy blessing, dear Father, with grateful hearts and in humility before thee in the name of thy Beloved Son Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>",

Thou didst also command Thy servant Joseph to build a house at Nauvoo wherein further development of the Holy Priesthood might be introduced, saying: \"For there is not a place found on earth that He may come and restore that which was lost unto you, or which He hath taken away, even the fullness of the Priesthood, for a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my Saints, may be baptized for those who are dead.\" And it is written: \"Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices, by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.\" This house was commenced by Thy servant Joseph, and completed by Thy servant Brigham and the Twelve; and in it were revealed many great and precious principles and ordinances which had previously been communicated to a chosen few before Thy servant Joseph's death. And as Thou didst give a standing commandment that Thy people were always to build houses unto Thy holy name, when Thy people came here unto this land, even the land of Zion, Thy servant Brigham, according to this commandment and Thy manifestations unto him, did build a house in St. George, in this Territory, wherein many precious principles have been developed, and much labor performed according to Thy holy ordinances, in the interests of the living and the dead; so we have now completed this, another house, which we this day dedicate and consecrate unto Thee, that we may be further prepared to carry out Thy will, to administer in Thine ordinances, to purify and instruct Thy Church, and to build up and establish Thy Zion on the earth, which Thou hast decreed should be accomplished in the dispensation of the fullness of times. We feel, O Lord God, our weakness and unworthiness before Thee, and our inability to do anything without Thy guidance and assistance; but as Thou hast given us a commandment, in common with others, we have built this house, and present it to Thee, and pray that Thou wilt accept it in the name of Thy Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Redeemer. We dedicate the ground on which it is built, as also by which it is surrounded, known as the Temple Block; we dedicate the foundation upon which it rests, the stones, the mortar, the doors, the stairs, the windows, the floors, the fastenings, the ceilings and roof, the painting and ornamentation, the stands for the Holy Priesthood, the baptismal font and the various rooms associated therewith, and also all the rooms for the performance of ordinances and the various purposes for which they are designed, the heating apparatus, and the furniture and everything therein from the foundation to the towers thereof, unto Thee, the Lord our God, that it may be a place most holy, wherein Thine ordinances may be performed, and Thy Priesthood administered according to Thy holy law, and in accordance with Thy will and purposes pertaining to the human family. For Thou, O God, hast ordained the principles which have been developed for the blessing, salvation and exaltation of the human race, and hast appointed Thy holy ordinances for the endowment of Thy Holy Priesthood and in the interests of the living and the dead; that Thy servants may go forth to the nations of the earth endowed with power from on high, and bear a message of salvation, even as Thy messengers to all the family of Adam, according to Thy word. And that Thy people may be prepared through the ordinances of Thine House to inherit thrones, principalities, powers, dominions and exaltations in the eternal worlds. And, also, that Thy purposes pertaining to the redemption of the dead may be carried out strictly in accordance with Thy law, that in this Thy holy house Thine ordinances may be performed in the interest of those who have died without a knowledge of the gospel; and that Thy servants and handmaidens who may officiate in Thy holy ordinances therein may thus become saviors upon Mount Zion, even according to the words of Thine ancient servant Malachi, wherein he stated that it was necessary that the hearts of the fathers should be turned to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, and that according to later revelations, a welding, connecting link might bind together the living and the dead in fraternal and patriarchal relations, according to the holy order which exists with the Gods; and a bond of union and fellowship be brought about between the heavens and the earth, for Thou hast said that they without us cannot be made perfect, and that we without them cannot be made perfect; we pray Thee, therefore, O God, that those who officiate here may act prudently, wisely and intelligently, with purity, virtue and honor before Thee, and perform their duties acceptably in this Thy Temple on earth.</p><p>And we also pray Thee, O Father, that Thy Priesthod may be assisted by Thy Holy Priesthood in the heavens, that Priesthood which is after the order of the Son of God, after the order of Melchizedek, and after the power of an endless life, which administers in time and eternity, to impart unto us by Thy direction and according to Thy will, a correct knowledge of all laws, rites and ordinances, and direction how to administer and to whom to administer; that there may be a perfect union and harmony, if we are counted worthy, between the Priesthood on the earth and the Priesthood in the heavens. And that Thou wouldst teach us Thy will and Thy law, and Thine ordinances more fully and completely, and reveal unto us the abundance of truth and intelligence associated with the interests of the living and the dead; that knowing Thy will we may do Thy will on earth as it is done in heaven.</p><p>And as Thou hast said, among other things, pertaining to Thine house, that in it we were to seek diligently and teach one another words of wisdom, \"Yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning by study and also by faith,\" and Thou hast further instructed us to \"become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues and people,\" and obtain a knowledge of nations, kingdoms, governments and laws, and Thou hast declared that there is \"a time to come in which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many Gods, they shall be manifest.\"</p><p>\"All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and also if there be bounds set to the heavens, or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon or stars; all the times of their revolutions; all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months and years, and all their glories, laws and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fullness of times. According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other Gods, before this world was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into His eternal presence, and into His immortal rest.\" And, as all wisdom dwells with thee, and, as all light, truth and intelligence flow from Thee, we humbly seek unto Thee for Thy blessing to rest upon this house, that it may be indeed a house of learning under Thy guidance, direction and inspiration, as Thou didst ordain the laws of the universe, and art the Creator and Sustainer of worlds, and the Regulator of their times and seasons, we ask that in this house a more full knowledge of Thee and Thy laws may be developed, and that those things spoken of by Thy servant Joseph may begin to be made manifest. We therefore pray Thee to grant that when Thy people draw nigh unto Thee in the holy order that Thou hast appointed and revealed, that Thou will hear their prayers, and look with favor upon their supplications, which are made in accordance with Thy word, and Thy will and Thy law. And if we are accounted worthy, and it is in accordance with Thy will and purposes, and not incompatible with the holy order which exists among the Gods, and that Thou hast ordained, we pray Thee that Thy presence may be with us. We pray also that the presence of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior, may be here, and that the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, may be our guide and instructor, and that Thine angels may be permitted to visit this holy habitation and communicate with Thy Priesthood in the interests of the living and the dead.</p><p>We also pray Thee, as Thou hast revealed unto us many things, to give us a more clear knowledge of the telestial, terrestrial, and celestial glories, and the laws, regulations and bounds by which they are governed; and the duties and responsibilities connected with each, that we may be enabled more fully to comprehend our duties, responsibilities and obligations, pertaining to all men in the various conditions and associations of life, and connected also with this nation and other nations of the world, that we may be enabled to act justly, prudently, righteously and intelligently in all the various relations of life, pertaining to social, religious, political and other duties devolving upon us, and that we may comprehend always fully the relationship that we sustain to this nation, to other nations, and to the world generally in which we live, and understand more perfectly our responsibilities to the living and the dead, to the wicked and corrupt, to the honorable and upright among men; to Thee, our heavenly Father, to Jesus, the Mediator of the New Covenant, to the Ancient of Days, and to the different orders, quorums and organizations of the holy Priesthood, and to our brethren generally, in this the land of Zion.</p><p>We ask thee to bless the nation in which we live and the rulers thereof, for we are persuaded, O Lord, that while great wickedness and corruption abound in all grades of society, that there are hundreds of thousands of honorable men who are desirous to do right and maintain the principles of freedom and the liberty of men, and who do not and cannot acquiesce in the measures taken by the thoughtless and uninformed, who seem to be desirous to injure Thy people, many of whom, however, through the circulation of misrepresentation and falsehood, do not comprehend the position which Thy people occupy, nor the principles by which they are governed. Enlighten their minds, we pray Thee, and lead them in the paths of life. Bless, we pray Thee, all the upright, the pure and virtuous who are seeking to maintain and sustain the glorious principles of freedom enunciated in the Constitution of the United States, and who are opposed to tyranny, misrule and oppression; and save this nation, O God, from the infamy, under guise of law, of being the spoliators and robbers of a virtuous, inoffensive and God-fearing people, in violation of their constitutional rights, and because they fear and reverence Thee and Thy laws but may this house be preserved unto us as a holy place wherein to worship Thee, and to administer Thine ordinances, to learn Thy laws, the laws of the universe\u2014embracing the world and other worlds; for the instruction of Thy people in the higher branches of education in all true intelligence, scientific, linguistic, natural and theological.</p><p>Bless the honest and upright throughout the world, and lead the erring in the paths of righteousness; and as Thou hast decreed that terrible judgments shall overtake the ungoldly, we leave these things, O Lord, in Thy hands, and wish to conform ourselves to Thy will.</p><p>Preserve us, O God, in these valleys of the mountains, and let not our enemies and Thine enemies triumph over Thy people, and suffer them not to bring us into bondage, for Thou, O Lord, knowest that we are seeking to do Thy will and carry out Thy laws; preserve us, therefore, in our immunities, liberties and rights, and save us from the menacing power of tyranny and oppression, for our trust, O God, is in Thee.</p><p>Bless, we pray Thee, the councils and authorities of the Church; the First Presidency, the Twelve with their council, the Patriarchs, the Presidents of Stakes, the High Councils and Bishops thereof, together with the Seventies, High Priests, Elders, Priests, Teachers, Deacons, and all the quorums and authorities of Thy Church, as also all the helps, aids and governments pertaining thereto, the Relief Societies, the Sunday School, the Primary and the Mutual Improvement Associations, and all men and women who are seeking for the welfare of Zion. Bless all our friends who are not of us, who are desirous to maintain the principles of virtue, integrity, honor and freedom. We pray Thee also to bless those who have assisted to build this house, the committee of construction, the architects, the superintendents, the workmen in all their various branches that have contributed by their industry and talent to construct this building as a habitation for Thee, our God; bless the Stakes of this Temple district, as well as all persons who have contributed of their means thereunto, or in any wise assisted in the construction thereof. Let the fear of God rest upon all Thy people. Preserve them in the principles of honor, of virtue, of truth, of integrity, and in the love of God, that they may be worthy of Thy blessings. Let the people praise Thee, O God; let all the people praise Thee. O Lord, our God, hear us in the heavens, and answer us upon the earth, that Zion may arise and shine, that the glory of God may rest upon her. That thy people may be preserved from the errors of vanity, the follies and corruptions of the world; that they may progress and excel in every principle of integrity, intelligence, virtue and purity, until Zion shall become the praise and glory of the whole earth, and Thy will be begun to be done on earth as it is in heaven. We ask this at Thy hands, and dedicate this house unto Thee, together with ourselves, our wives, our children, our houses, our lands, our flocks and herds, and our possessions, for time and all eternity, in the name of Thy Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>", 
    "london": "<p>O God, our Heavenly Father, Thou who hast created all things, whose plans infinite and progressive, ever serve to foster closer relationship between Thee and the human family.  We, Thy children, assemble before Thee this day in gratitude and praise.  Thou hast said that Thy work and Thy glory is \"to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\"</p><p>Therefore, human beings are engaged in life's highest activity when they cooperate with Thee in bringing about this consummation.  Earth with its barren rocks and saline seas, and lifeless planetary systems would be purposeless without the creation of intelligent human beings.  Only in their creation and eternal destiny do we find the answer to the question:</p><p>\"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?  And the son of Man, that Thou visitest him?</p><p>\"For Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.\"</p><p>Plainly Thy glory is not in lifeless formations, but in the \"immortality and eternal life of man.\"</p><p>Temples are but one means of man's cooperation with Thee in accomplishing this divine purpose.</p><p>On the occasion of the dedication of this, the fourteenth temple, may we first express overwhelming gratitude just to be alive in this great age of the world.  We pause this morning to open our hearts to Thee for this special privilege.  No other time in world history has been so wonderful\u2014no other age wherein Thy secret powers have been more within human control; in no other era hath Thy purposes been nearer human comprehension.  Help us, O Lord, truly to live!</p><p>Next to life we express gratitude for the gift of free agency.  When Thou didst create man, Thou placed within him part of Thine omnipotence and bade him choose for himself.  Liberty and conscience thus became a sacred part of human nature.  Freedom not only to think, but to speak and to act is a God-given privilege.</p><p>Thou didst inspire Thy servant Brigham Young to say, \"Every man's independence is sacred to him\u2014it is a portion of that same Deity that rules in the heavens.  There is not a being upon the face of the earth who is made in the image of God, who stands erect and is organized as God is, that should be deprived of the free exercise of his agency so far as he does not infringe upon others' rights save by good advice and good example.\"</p><p>Personal liberty is the paramount essential to human dignity and human happiness.</p><p>Down through the ages men have been free to accept or to reject Thy righteous plan.  History records how many have yielded to the enticements of the flesh, and how few, comparatively speaking, have followed the path of light and truth that leads to happiness and eternal life!</p><p>But Thy mercy, Thy wisdom, Thy love are infinite; and in dispensations past Thou hast pleaded, as Thou dost now plead, through chosen and authoritatively appointed servants, for Thy erring children to heed the gospel message and come to Thee.  Holy temples are a means of extending Thy loving mercy to Thy children even beyond the grave.</p><p>When in the Middle Ages the church departed from Christ's teachings Thou didst inspire honest, upright men here in Great Britain to raise their voices against corrupt practices.  Mingling with the denunciatory messages of Luther and Melanchthon in Germany, and Swingli in Switzerland, were the voices of George Wishart and later John Knox of Scotland.  We thank Thee that before the scorching flames silenced his tongue and reduced his body to ashes Thou didst permit George Wishart to glimpse that \"This realm shall be illuminated with the light of Christ's evangel, as clearly as ever was any realm since the days of the apostles.  Thou house of God shall be builded in it; yea, it shall not lack the very copestone.\"</p><p>Much clearer was the inspiration given President Wilford Woodruff, and President Joseph F. Smith, and other more recent apostles, who stated prophetically that \"Temples of God...will be erected in the divers countries of the earth,\" and that \"Temples will appear all over the land of Joseph\u2014North and South America\u2014and also in Europe and elsewhere; and all the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who received not the gospel in the flesh, must be officiated for in the temples of God before the Savior can present the kingdom to the Father, saying 'It is finished.'\"</p><p>We are grateful that in 1837 and 1840 authorized messengers were sent to Great Britain to announce to the people of the British Isles that God had again spoken from the heavens and re- established in its purity and fulness the gospel of Jesus Christ; that thousands accepted the message and subsequently emigrated to the headquarters of the Church.</p><p>We thank Thee that Thou, Great Elohim, and Jehovah, Thy Beloved Son, answered the fervent appeal of the lad Joseph Smith, and through subsequent administrations of angels enabled and authorized him to organize the Church of Jesus Christ in its completeness with apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc., as it was established in the days of the Savior and the apostles in the Meridian of Time.</p><p>In keeping with the unwavering truth that Thy Church must be established by divine authority, Thou didst send heavenly messengers to confer upon the Prophet Joseph Smith and others the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods, and subsequently all the keys of the priesthood ever held by Thy prophets from Adam, the Ancient of Days, through Abraham and Moses, Malachi and Elijah, with authority to \"turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers\" down to the latest generation.  For this consistency, and completeness of restoration of authority, we express gratitude on this occasion and praise Thy holy name.</p><p>We express gratitude to Thee for the leaders of Thy Church from the Prophet Joseph Smith through the years to the present General Authorities\u2014The First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve Apostles, the Assistants to the Twelve, the Patriarch to the Church, the First Council of the Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric.</p><p>With humility and deep gratitude we acknowledge Thy nearness, Thy divine guidance and inspiration.  Help us, we pray Thee, to become even more susceptible in our spiritual response to Thee.</p><p>Bless the presidencies of stakes, high councils, presidencies of missions, bishoprics of wards, presidencies of branches, presidencies of quorums, superintendencies, and presidencies of auxiliary associations throughout the world\u2014make them keenly aware of the fact that they are trusted leaders, and that they are to hold sacred that trust as they treasure their lives.</p><p>We are grateful that the members of the Church recognize that the payment of tithes and offerings brings blessings and makes possible the proclamation of the gospel to the ends of the world, and contributes to the carrying out of Thy purposes through the building of chapels, tabernacles, and eventually temples wherever the Church is organized in all lands and climes.</p><p>It is fitting that we express appreciation of the signing of the Magna Carta in the County of Surrey, the same county in which we meet today wherein the promise is given that no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized or outlawed or exiled...without proper trial by his peers or by the law of the land.</p><p>This protection of the individual is in keeping with Thy divine will; and any group of men who advocate an ideology that would deprive man of this individual right and heritage and make him a vassal of the state stamp themselves at once as enemies of Thy divine purposes.</p><p>We express gratitude for the right of free peoples to resort to the ballot, and for freedom to meet in legislative halls to consider problems and settle difficulties without fear or coercion of dictators, of secret police, or of slave camps.  O Father, help people everywhere more clearly to realize that government exists for the protection of the individual, not the individual for the government.</p><p>Bless, we beseech Thee, Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the II, the Houses of Parliament, and all branches of government throughout her Majesty's realm, that the high reputation of this great government for the proper and just enforcement of law may continue to be meritoriously maintained.</p><p>May the United States government with Great Britain, her Dominions, and freedom-loving countries everywhere, including South American republics, hold so sacredly the principles of self-government, and give to their peoples such enjoyment of peace, tranquility, and opportunities for progress as will make communistic governments of dictatorship, of mock trials, of unjust imprisonment, of enforced tyranny, so universally reprehensible as to be discarded forever by liberty-loving peoples.</p><p>That peace may eventually prevail, Thou hast again restored in its fulness the gospel, and established authoritatively the Church of Jesus Christ.  Even so, there are millions who are being influenced by false ideologies which are disturbing the peace of mind and distorting the thinking of honest men and women.  O Lord, guide and protect Thy messengers in their efforts to convince honest people in all lands and climes that Jesus Christ is \"the way, the truth, and the light\" and that \"there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.\"</p><p>Bless well-meaning men in all climes as they strive to hasten the day when men will renounce contention and strife and desire to use the great nuclear discoveries of the present day not for war and destruction, but for peace and spiritual advancement.</p><p>To this end, we beseech Thee to influence leaders of nations that their minds may be averse to war, their hearts cleansed from prejudice, suspicion, and hate, and filled with a desire for peace and goodwill.</p><p>While his body lay in the tomb Christ, Thy Beloved Son, preached to the spirits in prison who once were disobedient in the days of Noah, thus evidencing that those who have passed beyond the veil must also hear the word of God and obey the eternal principles of life and salvation.</p><p>Temples are built to Thy holy name as a means of uniting Thy people, living and dead, in bonds of faith, of peace, and of love throughout eternity.</p><p>Help all, O Father, to realize more keenly and sincerely than ever before that only by obedience to eternal principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ may loved ones who died without baptism be permitted the glorious privilege of entrance into Thy kingdom.</p><p>Increase our desire, therefore, to put forth even greater effort toward the consummation of Thy purposes.</p><p>To this end, by the authority of the Holy Priesthood, we dedicate this, the London Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and consecrate and set it apart for the sacred purposes, for which it has been erected.  We ask Thee to accept this edifice and to guard it from foundation to tower.  Protect it from earthquakes, tempestuous storms, or other devastating holocausts.  We dedicate the ground on which it stands and by which it is surrounded.  May the baptismal font, the ordinance rooms, and especially the sealing rooms be kept holy that Thy spirit may be ever present to comfort and to inspire.</p><p>Bless the persons who are charged to look after all mechanical installations and fixtures that they may do so skillfully, faithfully, and reverently.</p><p>Bless the president of the temple and his wife as matron.  Let humility temper their feelings; wisdom, and kind consideration guide their actions.  May they, and others, who will be appointed as assistants and custodians, maintain an atmosphere of cleanliness and holiness in every room.  Let no unclean person or thing ever enter herein; for, \"my spirit,\" sayeth the Lord, \"will not dwell in unclean tabernacles\"; neither will it remain in a house where selfish, arrogant, or unwholesome thoughts abide.  Therefore may all who enter this holy temple come with clean hands and pure hearts that Thy Holy Spirit may ever be present to comfort, to inspire, and to bless.</p><p>If any with gloomy forebodings or heavy hearts enter, may they depart with their burdens lightened and their faith increased; if any have envy or bitterness in their hearts, may such feelings be replaced by self-searching and forgiveness.  May all who come within these sacred walls feel a peaceful, hallowed influence.  Cause, O Lord, that even people who pass the grounds, or view the temple from afar, may lift their eyes from the groveling things of sordid life and look up to Thee and acknowledge Thy providence.</p><p>Through love for Thee, our Heavenly Father, and their fellow men, faithful members of Thy Church, and others who believe in Thee, have made possible by tithes and other generous contributions the erection and completion of this Thy holy house.</p><p>Accept of our offering, hallow it by Thy presence, protect it by Thy power.</p><p>With this prayer we re-dedicate our lives to the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth for the peace of the world, and to Thy glory forever, in the name of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>", 
    "losangeles": "<p>O God, our Eternal Father, Creator of the earth and of the teeming manifestations of life thereon, we, Thy children, assembled in dedicatory services in this house built unto Thy most Holy Name\u2014plead that we may be accepted of Thee.</p><p>May we feel Thy presence and the presence of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things were made and only through whom will the consummation of Thy divine purposes pertaining to the inhabitants of the earth be wrought.  That we may thus sense Thy presence and have assurance that our prayers are heard by Thee, may every heart in this edifice this day be clean and pure before Thee, and every mind be willing to do Thy will and to work for the accomplishment of Thy purposes.</p><p>When our first parents chose to take upon themselves mortality, they knew that they would be driven from Thy divine presence and that their only hope of ever regaining it would be dependent upon Thy revealing Thyself to them through Thy Beloved Son, who would give to them the plan of salvation.  Today, we express heartfelt gratitude to Thee for having given in the beginning the gospel plan, the power of God unto salvation, and with it man's free agency, a part of Thy divinity wherein man may choose the right and merit salvation, or choose the wrong and merit condemnation.</p><p>Down through the ages men have been free to accept or reject Thy righteous plan.  Thou knowest, and history records, how many in wickedness yield to the enticements of the flesh, and how few, comparatively, follow the path of light and truth that leads to happiness and eternal life.</p><p>But Thy mercy, Thy love, Thy wisdom are infinite!  And in dispensations past Thou hast pleaded, as Thou dost now plead, through chosen servants for Thy erring children to repent and come unto Thee.</p><p>We thank Thee that Thou, O Great Elohim, and Jehovah, Thy Beloved Son, didst appear to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and through the subsequent administrations of angels didst enable him to organize the Church of Jesus Christ in its completeness with apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists as it was established in the days of the Savior and his apostles in the Meridian of Time.</p><p>In keeping with the unwavering truth that Thy Church must be established by divine authority, Thou didst send heavenly messengers to bestow upon the Prophet Joseph Smith and others the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods, and subsequently all the keys of the priesthood ever held by Thy prophets from the days of Adam, through Abraham and Moses, to Malachi who testifies of the authority of Elijah to \"turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers\" down to the latest generation.  For this completeness and consistency of restoration of authority, we express gratitude today and praise Thy holy name.</p><p>We are grateful for this land of America, \"choice above all other lands.\"  The freedom vouchsafed by the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to every man the right to worship Thee in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience, made possible the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  O Father, may the American people not forget Thee!  Help us to see the greatness of this country and to minimize its weaknesses.  We express gratitude for the right of the people to resort to the ballot, and for freedom to meet in legislative halls to settle problems and disputes without fear of coercion of dictators, secret police, or slave camps.  Help people everywhere to sense more clearly that government exists for the protection of the individual\u2014not the individual for the government.</p><p>Bless, we beseech Thee, the President of the United States, his Cabinet, the houses of Congress, and the judiciary.  Give the President health and wisdom needful for the leadership now placed upon him.</p><p>We express gratitude to Thee for the men whom Thou hast chosen to lead the Church from the Prophet Joseph Smith, his brother Hyrum, and other associates, their successors through the years down to the present General Authorities\u2014The First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, the Assistants to the Twelve, the Patriarch to the Church, the First Council of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric.</p><p>Continue to reveal to the President and his counselors, the First Presidency, Thy mind and will concerning the growth and advancement of Thy work among the children of men.</p><p>We have felt Thy presence and in times of doubt and perplexity have hearkened unto Thy voice.  Here in Thy holy house, in humility and deep gratitude we acknowledge Thy divine guidance, Thy protection and inspiration.  This is truly Thy work\u2014help us to be able representatives, faithful and true!</p><p>Bless the presidencies of stakes, the high councils, the presidencies of missions, the bishoprics of wards, presidencies of branches, presidencies of quorums--Melchizedek and Aaronic; presidencies and superintendencies of auxiliary associations throughout the world\u2014make them keenly conscious of the fact that they are trusted leaders and that they are to keep that trust as sacredly as they guard their lives.</p><p>This edifice, as eleven other temples dedicated to Thy holy name, is a magnificent monument testifying to the faith and loyalty of the members of Thy Church in the payment of their tithes and offerings.  Not only the building of temples is thus made possible in different parts of the world, but also the proclaiming of the restored gospel, and the carrying out of Thy purposes by the building of chapels, tabernacles, and recreation halls wherever needed by churches organized in many lands and climes.</p><p>In this respect, we invoke Thy blessing particularly upon Thy people and their friends in this temple district who have so willingly and generously contributed their means, time, and effort to the completion of this imposing, impressive house of the Lord.  May each contributor be comforted in spirit and prospered a hundredfold!  May all be assured that they have the gratitude of thousands, perhaps millions, on the other side for whom the prison doors may now be opened and deliverance proclaimed to those who will accept the truth and be set free.</p><p>For this purpose Thou hast revealed that the gospel is to be preached to those who have passed beyond the veil, as well as to the millions now living whose faith in Thee and in Thy gospel is faltering and unstable, who are now being influenced by false ideologies, which are disturbing the peace of mind and distorting the thinking of honest men and women.  May the temples, tabernacles, churches, wherever a branch or ward of the Church is organized, declare even in silence that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the light, and that \"\u2026there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\"</p><p>Guide us, O God, in our efforts to hasten the day when men will renounce contention and strife, when \"...nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\"  To this end, we beseech Thee to influence the leaders of nations that their minds may be averse to war, their hearts cleansed from prejudices, suspicions, and avarice, and filled with a desire for peace and righteousness.</p><p>Temples are built to Thy Holy Name as a means of uniting Thy people in bonds of faith, of peace, and of love.</p><p>Today, therefore, we come before Thee with joy and thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and hearts filled with praise that we are permitted to participate in the dedicatory service of this, the twelfth temple to be dedicated to Thee since the organization of Thy Church.  Millions have had their attention drawn to it\u2014many through curiosity, some because of its beauty in structure, others because of its lofty purpose.  Help all, O Father, to realize more keenly and sincerely than ever before that only by obedience to eternal principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ may loved ones who died without baptism be permitted the glorious privilege of entrance into the kingdom of God. Increase our desire, therefore, to put forth even greater effort towards the consummation of Thy purpose to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of all Thy children.</p><p>To this end, by authority of the Holy Priesthood, we dedicate this, the Los Angeles Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and consecrate it for the sacred purposes for which it has been erected.  We ask Thee to accept this edifice and to guard it from foundation to statue.  Protect it from earthquakes, hurricanes, tempestuous storms, or other devastating holocausts.  We dedicate the ground on which it stands and by which it is surrounded.  May the baptismal font, the ordinance rooms, and especially the sealing rooms be kept holy that Thy spirit may be ever present to comfort and to inspire.  Protect all mechanical parts pertaining to lighting, heating, ventilating system, elevators.  Bless the persons who are charged to look after all such installations and fixtures that they may do so faithfully, skillfully, and reverently.</p><p>Bless the president of the temple, and his wife as matron.  Let humility temper their feelings; wisdom and kind consideration guide their actions.  May they, and others, who will be appointed as assistants and custodians, maintain an atmosphere of cleanliness and holiness in every room.  Let no unclean person or thing ever enter herein, for \"my spirit,\" saith the Lord, \"will not dwell in unclean tabernacles\"; neither will it remain in a house where selfish, arrogant, or unwholesome thoughts abide. Therefore may all who seek this holy temple come with clean hands and pure hearts that Thy Holy Spirit may ever be present to comfort, to inspire, and to bless.  If any with gloomy forebodings or heavy hearts enter, may they depart with their burdens lightened and their faith increased; if any have envy or bitterness in their hearts, may such feelings be replaced by self-searching and forgiveness.  May all who come within these sacred walls feel a peaceful, hallowed influence.  Cause, O Lord, that even people who pass the grounds, or view the temple from afar, may lift their eyes from the groveling things of sordid life and look up to Thee and Thy providence.</p><p>Now, dear Lord, our Eternal Father, through love for Thee and their fellow men, faithful members of Thy Church, and others who believe in Thee, by tithes and other generous contributions, have made possible the erection and completion of this Thy holy house, in which will be performed ordinances and ceremonies essential to the happiness, salvation, and exaltation of Thy children living in mortality and in the spirit world. Accept of our offering, hallow it by Thy presence, protect it by Thy power. With this prayer we dedicate our lives to the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth for the peace of the world and to Thy glory forever, in the name of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>",

We dedicate it unto Thee as Thy hallowed dwelling place. We dedicate it unto Thy Son as the house of the Lord where the fulness of the priesthood may be exercised. We dedicate it as a house of worship, a house of covenants, a house of faith, a house of God.</p><p>We dedicate the grounds on which it stands with all its vegetation; the building from the footings to the top of the steeple with its crowning figure of Moroni; the walls and windows that they may stand against the storms of nature and be looked upon with reverence and respect; all the interior and exterior elements of this structure and its surroundings; the baptistry, the endowment rooms, the sealing rooms, and the magnificent celestial room.</p><p>Wilt Thou accept this temple as the gift of our hearts and hands. May Thy Holy Spirit dwell here at all times and be felt by all who come within its portals. May a mantle of holiness come upon this sacred edifice. May it stand as a beacon of everlasting truth and light in this beautiful and unique part of Thy creation. Wilt Thou protect it from any who may be disposed to harm or defile it in any way.</p><p>May all who enter do so worthily. Wilt Thou seal upon them an endowment of righteousness that will become a guardian throughout their lives.</p><p>Bless the youth of Thy church with an understanding of the temple and the divinity of Thy work. May they be true and faithful throughout their lives.</p><p>Bless all who attend as patrons that Thy Spirit may rest upon them, that the sacred covenants of Thy house may be impressed upon their minds and hearts. We pray for those who shall serve and work in this temple in any capacity. May they do so with a spirit of dedication and love.</p><p>We pray for the temple president, his counselors, for the matron and her assistants as they serve Thee in their sacred responsibilities.</p><p>We thank Thee for faithful tithe-payers throughout the world whose consecrated offerings made possible this and other houses of the Lord. Open the windows of heaven and shower down blessings upon them. May they feel of Thy love and may Thine encircling arms of mercy be round about them.</p><p>Our Father in heaven, we love Thee. We know that Thou lovest us. We love Thy Beloved Son who stands at Thy side. We thank Thee for His atoning sacrifice. All of the blessings of this house rest upon that great divine act of the love of Thy Son, the Savior of all mankind.</p><p>Dear Father, accept our prayer as we dedicate this temple unto Thee, as we rededicate ourselves to Thee and Thy service, and we do it in the name of our Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>", 
    "manhattan": "<p>Lord God Omnipotent, Thou great Elohim, we bow before Thee this day with grateful hearts. We are met to dedicate this Thy sacred house. We exclaim with thanksgiving, \"Holiness to the Lord.\"</p><p>Our thoughts reach back to that glorious day when Thou didst reveal Thyself and Thy Son to the boy Joseph. This marked the ushering in of the last and final dispensation of Thy work, the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, gathering together in one magnificent whole all of the powers, authority, and keys of previous dispensations. We thank Thee that we have come forth in this season of history and that we are partakers of the blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p>We thank Thee for His atoning sacrifice. We thank Thee for the understanding Thou hast given us of the breadth and depth of the redemption wrought by Him in behalf of Thy sons and daughters of all generations. These temples, which now dot the earth, are necessary to the total fulfillment of the Savior's Atonement. Here, under the authority of the Holy Priesthood, will be administered those ordinances which lead not only to salvation, but also to eternal exaltation. Those who come worthily to this Thy holy house may receive these blessings for themselves, and may assist in extending the same to those who have passed beyond the veil of death. Here will be exercised the only authority under the heavens which reaches beyond to the realms of the dead. Therefore, those who serve within this house as proxies for the deceased will do so in the spirit of the incomparable vicarious service of Thy Son who gave His life for all mankind. And so, dear Father, our hearts overflow with gratitude on this glorious day.</p><p>Acting in the sacred name of Jesus Christ and under the authority of the Holy Priesthood, we dedicate and consecrate unto Thee and Thy Son this, the Manhattan New York Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We dedicate the structure within the walls of which it is built. We dedicate all of the rooms, hallways, offices, the baptistry, the facilities for the initiatory ordinances, the endowment rooms, the beautiful celestial room, the sealing rooms, and all other appurtenances and facilities which constitute this House of the Lord.</p><p>We offer them to Thee with faith and thanksgiving. Wilt Thou accept of them and cause Thy Holy Spirit to dwell here. We pray that within these hallowed walls there may be found peace and an environment of communion with Thee. May this temple be a place of quiet refuge in the midst of this great and noisy metropolis. May all who enter its portals feel they have stepped from the world into a place of Thy divine presence.</p><p>Preserve it, we ask Thee, by Thy power from any act of evil hands, and from any harmful manifestation of the forces of nature.</p><p>May none ever come here unworthily. May all come in a spirit of consecration and worship.</p><p>We pray for those who will serve here, the temple presidency, the matron and her assistants, and those who will assist them. May they do so in a spirit of love and kindness, reaching out to all who come as patrons.</p><p>We pray that as the youth enter the waters of baptism in behalf of those who have gone beyond, that they may experience within their own hearts an exhilarating feeling of sacred service. We pray that such service will build within them the strength to resist the evils of the world and to follow the pattern which Thou hast outlined for Thy children.</p><p>May all who participate in the endowment service, whether in their own behalf or in behalf of others, have impressed upon their minds the sanctity and the binding nature of those covenants which they will make with Thee. We pray that those who join hands in the sealing rooms, and who kneel at sacred altars, will sense with a great immediacy the binding nature of that which they do in Thy holy presence.</p><p>O God the Eternal Father, bless this Thy holy house. May Thy Spirit touch the hearts of all who come within these walls. May this place be hallowed unto each one. When they leave to return to their homes, may they carry with them something of the sweet and edifying experience which they have had here.</p><p>Father look down in mercy upon Thy people everywhere. Bless them as they walk in faith before Thee. Open the windows of heaven and shower Thy mercies upon them. May they grow in stature before their associates. May they be magnified in their various undertakings. May none lack the necessities of life, but may all be granted sustenance according to their needs.</p><p>We remember before Thee those who preside in other temples, those who preside in stakes and wards, in districts and branches, in missions, in the quorums of the priesthood, in the Relief Society and other organizations of Thy Church and kingdom. May all work with an eye single to Thy glory that light and truth and knowledge of things divine may crown their lives. We invoke Thy blessings upon those who preside in Thy Church. Watch over them and shelter and protect them, and lead them with revelation that will bless Thy people everywhere, that Thy work will be seen as a bright and shining star in a world oppressed with darkness.</p><p>Father, there is so much of evil in the world, of strife, of man's inhumanity to man. We pray that peace may come where there is war, that conciliation may come where there is conflict, that neighborliness and love may replace hatred and enmity.</p><p>Now, dear Father, accept of our petitions unto Thee. Hear our pleadings. Smile with love upon us as we reach out in love to Thee and Thy divine Son. As the Prophet Joseph prayed in Kirtland:</p><p>\"Help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!</p><p>\"And let these, thine anointed ones, be clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen, and Amen\" (Doctrine and Covenants 109:79-80).</p><p>We ask it all in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.</p>",

Its completion brings to full fruition the marvelous and wonderful work of establishing Thine eternal ordinances in this nation.  Now Thy sons and daughters of the Philippines have available every gift and blessing, every act and ordinance pertaining to the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p><p>Our hearts are filled with thanksgiving to Thee and to Thy Son whose redeeming sacrifice has made possible our salvation.

We thank Thee for the vision afforded the boy Joseph Smith when Thou and Thy Son appeared and opened the work of restoration.</p><p>We thank Thee for the coming forth of the Book of Mormon as another witness of the reality and divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ.  We thank Thee for the promise found therein that in the latter-days Thou wouldst remember Thy children on the isles of the sea.</p><p>This nation of the Philippines is a nation of many islands whose people love freedom and truth, whose hearts are sensitive to the testimony of Thy servants, and who are responsive to the message of the eternal gospel.

In a few short years it has grown from small beginnings to its present stature with many established stakes of Zion.</p><p>We thank Thee for the hospitality afforded Thy servants by the government of the Republic of the Philippines.  Bless the gracious officers of this nation, and preserve by Thy mighty power peace and freedom in the land.  Lift the blight of poverty from which so many suffer.  Particularly bless Thy faithful saints who live honestly with Thee in the payment of their tithes and offerings.  As was promised of old by Thy prophet Malachi, open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings that there shall not be room enough to receive them.  Bless Thy saints in their faith that they shall remain true as Thy covenant people.  Bless them in their homes that there shall be love and peace.  Bless them that neither they nor their generations after them will go hungry, nor naked, nor without shelter from the storms that beat about them.  Open their minds that they shall grow in wisdom in matters both spiritual and temporal.</p><p>May Thy Church in this island nation grow and increase in numbers.  May the evil designs of its enemies be frustrated.  May Thy work become as \"a city set upon a hill whose light cannot be hid.\"</p><p>O Father, we pray for Thy prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, whom we love and honor.  He is now old in years, his body worn from service to Thy children.  Sustain him by Thy power, and comfort and bless him.</p><p>We love Thee, our Father and our God.  We love Thy Son, our Redeemer and our Savior, the author of our salvation, He who gave His life as a ransom for all men.  Grant us faith and knowledge of things divine.  Grant us willing hearts and obedient spirits.  Grant us strength and the will to walk the straight and narrow way that leads to life eternal.  Bless us as a people, wherever we may be found, that we may be worthy of the respect and confidence of all men and that we may walk acceptably before Thee.</p><p>We thank Thee for this beautiful edifice and for all who have worked to make it possible.

We dedicate the building, all parts thereof and any related structures, with all of the facilities and furnishings thereof.  We dedicate the grounds and their plantings.  We dedicate it as the house of the Lord with shouts of hosanna unto Thee and the Lamb.  Wilt Thou deign to visit it and sanctify it with Thy presence.

    "manti": "<p>Almighty and Eternal Father, Creator of heaven and earth, and all that they contain, Thou who art the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and of the spirits of all living; to Thee, Thy believing children here present bring our offering and beseech Thee to grant Thy listening ear while we dedicate this Temple unto Thy most holy name.</p><p>We realize our weakness, our utter feebleness and inability to advance the interests and honor of Thy name upon the earth, except Thou dost guide us by Thy Holy Spirit; therefore, we humble ourselves in Thy presence, and earnestly entreat Thee to forgive us our sins and all vanity and unworthiness which Thy purity and perfection have discovered in any one of us, inasmuch as we are truly penitent therefore, and ready to forgive those who trespass against us.</p><p>We praise and adore Thee for having restored to earth again the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel, wherein Thou didst break the silence of ages by speaking to Thy servant Joseph Smith, while yet in the days of his youth, and by Thy presence and Thine own voice didst declare unto Him Thy well Beloved Son, our Savior, in whose name alone immortality and eternal life can be obtained; and Thou didst teach, discipline and empower Him to bring forth thy glorious latter-day work\u2014the dispensation of the fullness of times.</p><p>With the record of the Prophet Mormon, Thou didst entrust him with the Urim and Thummim, by which the unlettered youth was enabled to translate the language in which it was engraven though long since lost to the human family, and thereby revealed the origin, prosperity and downfall of the mighty nations that inhabited this hemisphere for more than twenty-five centuries of time, and also informing us that the pure gospel of a crucified and risen Redeemer had been delivered to, and His Church established among them.</p><p>We praise Thy name for revealing this knowledge which the wisdom of the world was unable to discover. Also that Thou didst authorize Thy servant Joseph to baptize for the remission of sins, by sending John the Baptist to ordain Joseph to that power; giving him also a promise that this ministry should abide in the earth until the sons of Levi shall again offer unto Thee, O Lord, an offering in righteousness.</p><p>In the plentitude of Thine everlasting love Thou didst also send Thine Apostles Peter, James and John, who conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood and apostleship, which enabled the Prophet Joseph to organize Thy Church and set in order all its appointments, offices and ordinances with its gifts and blessings, as in the former dispensations.</p><p>Everlasting praise to Thy Holy name for sending line upon line and precept upon precept, and continuing to reveal the abundance of peace and truth by sending Moses to confer the spirit with power to gather the House of Israel, and Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, that the whole earth might not be smitten with a curse.</p><p>When these manifestations of Thine unfathomable love to Thy Saints stirred up the envious hate of the ungodly to bloody persecution, imprisonment of Thy servants, and finally to extermination from the State of their chosen homes, Thine own right hand brought deliverance to Thy Saints, and gave them a happy respite while they built the beautiful Nauvoo. But there the wrath of the ungodly waxed furious again while Thou didst fill Thy servant Joseph with revelations of Thy will for the upbuilding of Zion and the exaltation of the righteous until nothing could subdue their insatible fury but the life-blood of Joseph and Hyrum and the expulsion of Thy people from the nation; yet Thy loving kindness failed not, and the heart of the savage Indians was moved to give us a kindly welcome.</p><p>We glorify Thy great and Holy name, Almighty Father, for these communications of intelligence and power to man in the flesh again, and that the Spirit, forseeing the hatred of the wicked that would be aroused by the developments thereof, moved Thy servant Joseph to seal all these keys of power and intelligence which he had received upon the heads of his brethren the Apostles, with commandment that they should build up Thy kingdom and establish its righteousness in the earth till Thy Son, our Savior, shall come.</p><p>Thy people being under a sense of these weighty obligations, and being driven out from among men, it seemed proper to Thee to make Thy servant Brigham mighty in wisdom and strength to lead Thy people in safety, and after a year and a half's journey in the desert among savage tribes, Thou didst give us rest in these valleys of the Rocky Mountains. In all these tribulations Thine ear heard and Thine own arm brought answers of deliverance to the supplications of Thine afflicted children. Nor wast thou weary of their necessities and entreaties, but didst soften the rigor of unfriendly elements, and didst cause the clouds to scatter refreshing showers, the hills to yield their treasures of snow, and springs of living water to come forth from the dry and parched ground. The labor of the husbandman has been crowned with plenty for man and beast, and much wherewith to bless the stranger. The everlasting hills have yielded their rich treasures of iron, lead, silver, and gold, while lightning and steam have contributed to gather Thy sons from afar and Thy daughters from the ends of the earth in swiftest ships, and without disaster.</p><p>How can we declare the multitude of all Thy mercies which Thou hast shown to Thy dependent, covenant children who have put their trust in Thee, for time would fail to mention the threatening famine by reason of the cricket, the locust and the grasshopper, when Thou didst send the gulls that swallowed them up, and the lives of Thy people were saved; or the earthquakes which have engulfed islands, provinces and cities, with the multitudes of their inhabitants, while Thy people have dwelt safely in this volcanic region, unharmed and undisturbed thereby; neither is the din of war heard in all our borders.</p><p>We praise Thy Holy name for all the mighty work Thou didst enable Thy chief apostle, Brigham, to perform; that he was moved to build and to appoint Temples according to Thy holy commandment in various cities of the land, and to designate that one should occupy this delightful spot. Since it has pleased Thee to take him to Thyself, Thine other chief apostle, John Taylor, was inspired and with his brethren did lay the foundations of this House, and with the free-will offerings of Thy Saints had reared it nearly to completion when his precious life was cut short by cruel persecution. We who are spared and are permitted to come together now dedicate this Temple unto Thee. We most earnestly pray that Thou wilt accept of this our offerings in the all-prevailing name of Thy Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.</p><p>We dedicate the ground and the hill on which it stands, that the same may be holy unto the Lord our God; that its steps, its terraces, its trees and shrubbery, with all its adornments and its approaches may be the pathways of the just to the House of the Lord, the Temple of our God. Let the foundation of this House be made permanent and never be moved from its place. May the stones and the cement of which the buildings is composed become compact and strong as if it were one solid rock.</p><p>We consecrate the basement of the lower story, which is in likeness of the home of the dead, with its baptismal font, for the service of the living and the dead, with its steps, the oxen on which the font rests, its seats, its rooms for changes, with all its doors and windows, their hangings and fastenings, the furniture and all that appertains to it. May the fountain which supplies it continue a living spring that shall never fail, and the stream become as a river of life to Thy believing penitent children; that they who shall be buried therein may effectually die unto sin, and in coming forth may as certainly arise to lives of righteousness and faith, the spirit bearing witness of the blood of Christ which cleanseth from all sin; and when the ordinance is performed for the dead, that they may realize its efficacy as if they had received it themselves while in the flesh, and be judged in like manner.</p><p>We dedicate and consecrate unto Thee and the service of Thy Saints, the lower and upper main courts, with all other apartments in this building which are sheltered by its roof, according to the various uses for which they have been designed, with their stands, their altars, their desks, the stairs by which they are reached, their doors and windows, their hangings and fastenings, together with floors, partitions, ceilings, finishings, furnishings and ornamentations, also all apparatus and fixtures for ventilating, warming, lighting and seating the same, whether they are for public worship, administering in the holy sacraments and ordinances of this Holy Temple or for private prayer and secret devotion; also all rooms that are used for study and learning words of wisdom from the best books, or by lectures and the experience of righteous and learned men able to teach the will and ways of the Lord, all these we dedicate unto Thee that all may be most holy and acceptable unto the Lord our God.</p><p>Wilt Thou accept and bless these sacred altars which have been erected by the offerings of Thy devoted Saints? And when Thy people shall approach Thee in Thine own appointed way, then do Thou hearken and hear their supplications; grant them deliverance from their adversaries; succor them in their temptations; give them knowledge of the ancestry of their generations that they may go forth in the holiness and power of Thine ordinances and as saviors on Mt. Zion redeem the generations of their dead and bring many sons and daughters unto Thee in Thy kingdom.</p><p>When Thy sons and daughters shall desire to plight their faith with each other unto Thee in a covenant of everlasting life and shall obtain admittance here in Thy holy courts, then O Lord, be pleased to accept their offerings; sanctify them, that they may be clean from all unrighteousness; clothe Thy servants with the habiliments of the Priesthood, and here at the shrine of Thy love seal them Thine by Thy Holy Spirit of promise until the day of their redemption, the resurrection of their bodies, as purchased by the blood of Christ Thy Son. May this holy Temple be to them as one of the gates of heaven, opening into the straight and narrow path that leads to endless lives and eternal dominion.</p><p>We dedicate the stands in the eastern portion of the building for the occupancy and ministration of the holy Melchizedek Priesthood, which has the keys of all spiritual blessings, is of the order of Thy Son Jesus Christ, and holds the power of endless lives.</p><p>We also consecrate the stands in the west of the building for the occupancy and ministration of the Aaronic Priesthood, which is an appendage to the Melchizedek Priesthood and holds the keys of temporal blessings.</p><p>We beseech Thee, our Heavenly Father, to inspire Thy ministering servants who shall instruct Thy people from these stands, that they may rightly divide the words of truth and give to each member of Thine household his portion of meat in due season, that from the treasures of Thy store house the riches of eternal life may exalt Thy children to a knowledge of Thyself.</p><p>May he who shall preside over the ministrations in this holy Temple, and all who labor with him, be greatly blessed with the understanding of Thy perfect law and all the applications thereof to the conditions of Thy people. When any difficult matter shall require his consideration, may the voice of Thy Holy Spirit give to him the revelations of Thy will, that all the ministrations of this Thy House and all the ordinances performed may be sanctioned in heaven, Thy holy habitation.</p><p>We dedicate to Thee the records which are and shall be kept of all the ordinances administered here in this Temple. May the recorders who shall have the care and labor of making and keeping them be abundantly blessed with wisdom and knowledge, that the same may be truthfully and faithfully kept and be found worthy of all acceptation, that Thy people may be righteously judged according to all that shall be written therein. We earnestly pray that they may be preserved most holy unto Thee from all violence and desecration, until they shall have accomplished the full object and purpose of their creation.</p><p>O Lord God of our fathers, of the prophets, and of Thy people, we beseech Thee accept the dedication of this Temple, with all that appertains to it, including the foundation and the towers thereof, unto Thyself.</p><p>May this delightful location be known as a holy hill of Zion, among Thy people. Graciously be pleased to place Thy name upon this House. Let the power of Thy Spirit be felt by all who shall enter within its portals. Give Thine angels charge concerning it, that it shall never be possessed by Thine enemies, neither be defiled by the wicked and ungoldly, nor even be injured by any destructive elements, but grant that it may stand and endure as a monument of the obedience and love of Thy people, and to the honor of Thy holy name for ages yet to come in holiness to the Lord.</p><p>We praise Thee for Thy goodness in enabling Thy servants to translate and send abroad the fulness of Thy Gospel as contained in the Book of Mormon into so many languages of the various nations of the earth; do Thou bless the humble efforts of Thy faithful servants in all the various peoples and tongues among whom it has penetrated that they may bear a faithful testimony of the truth that has sprung out of the ground, and of the righteousness that has looked down from heaven.</p><p>Have Thou mercy upon Judah and Jerusalem; hasten the going forth of this sacred record to the Hebrews of all nations; raise up men and means to carry the glad tidings of Thy returning favor to that afflicted people. Wilt Thou hear and answer the prayers of Thy servants and turn away the barrenness of their land? Make it very fertile as in days of old; turn the hearts of the exiles to Thy promises made to their fathers, and let the land of Jerusalem become inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein, that they may rebuild their city and temple, that the glory of the later house may be greater than that of the former house.</p><p>We render thanks and praise to Thy holy name for the measure of Thy Spirit sent forth among the scattered remnants of the seed of Joseph; that they are pleased and comforted at hearing of the record of their fathers; that, where they have opportunity, they incline to the arts of peace and self support. O, may the power of the Gospel, through obedience, enable them to be relieved from the terrible curse which is upon them, break forth into the light of Zion, and obtain a fulfillment of the promises made unto their fathers.</p><p>We beseech Thee, let Thy peculiar blessings rest upon Thy servants, the Twelve Apostles, according to the arduous and important labor and presidency which have developed upon them by the death of Thy servant, President John Taylor. Wilt Thou strengthen Thy servant who is called to preside over them and the Church with continual inspiration of the Holy Spirit; preserve him in health, accept the labors of his life and fill him with the spirit and power of his holy apostleship. May the apostles be united in the bond of perfectness with each other and prevail with Thee for abundance and richness of Thy word, to dispense to Thy people. Preserve them from the hands of their enemies until they shall accomplish their work. Give them power to send Thy Gospel to all nations, kindreds, tongues and peoples, to gather Thine elect from all lands, to build up Thy Zion and establish Thy righteousness in the earth, and to attain to the power of their calling and apostleship in the flesh.</p><p>O Lord, bless the Patriarchs whom Thou hast appointed in the land of Zion. May they have power to seal blessings upon Thy people by inspiration, as did the ancient fathers, that their blessings may be fulfilled upon the heads of their descendants and of Thy people.</p><p>Bless the Seventies with their Presidency, to magnify their calling in all lands where their lots may be cast, or where they may be appointed to labor, that Thine Elders may praise Thee and all the ends of the earth hear of the salvation of our God.</p><p>Bless those who preside over the various missions in all the earth, that they may dispense the Gospel by all proper means within their reach, by writing, by publishing, by sending Thine Elders to all places where the word of God may have free course and be glorified by the obedience of the honest in heart.</p><p>Endow Thou Thy servants, the High Priests, with all the gifts and qualifications of their holy calling.</p><p>We pray Thee to bless the Stakes of Zion which Thou hast established. May their Presidents, Counselors, High Councils, with the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders and all that constitute the authorities of Thy Church, abide in the revelation of Thy Will, that Zion may lengthen her cords and strengthen her stakes in all righteousness.</p><p>Enable the Bishops and High Councils to decree justice and judgments in equity and truth, that the Wards and Stakes of Zion may be built up in holiness, that we may be Thy people and Thou be our God. Bless with them the Priests, Teachers and Deacons, the standing ministry to Thy Church, that they may be vigilant to put away iniquity from Thy Church, that Thou mayest bestow upon Thy people the fulness of Thy favor, Thine everlasting love.</p><p>We pray for Thy blessing upon the Relief Societies, the Young Ladies' and Young Men's Associations, the Sabbath Schools, and the Primaries, with all those who are appointed to superintend and preside over them; that they may be abundantly blessed in relieving the sufferings of the destitute and sorrowful, arresting the wayward, and inspiring them with love for pure intelligence, and educating them in the way of life and faith, that our youth may find Thee early, and the aged be established in Thy righteousness forever.</p><p>We dedicate ourselves, with our wives, our children, our houses and lands, our flocks and herds, our gardens and vineyards, with all that we are and have, unto Thee, the Lord our God, for time and for all eternity, and for the accomplishment of the work which Thou hast given us to do.</p><p>Heavenly Father, Thou hast seen the labors of Thy Saints in the building of this House. Their motives and their exertions are all known to Thee. The hearts of the children of men and every thought thereof are open to Thy sight. Thy people have sought to do Thy will in rearing and adorning this great structure. They have contributed freely of the means which Thou hast given them for its erection, and the hands of the committee and of the superintendent and assistant superintendent have been strengthened and their hearts been gladdened thereby. Even the children of Thy people have shown delight in helping to purchase the curtains, the carpets and the furniture of this House. We this day present it to Thee, O Lord our God, as the fruit of the tithings and free will offerings of Thy people. Accept this, we beseech Thee, and let Thy choice blessings rest down upon every man, woman and child who has contributed to the building and adorning of this Temple. Bless them with increased faith and with all the blessings of heaven and earth in due season; that in heavenly gifts, in their basket and in their store, in their children, in their flocks and in their herds, in their fruits of the earth, and in the conveniences and comforts of life, they may abound and ever increase. If there are any of Thy people, O Father, who have not had the means to assist in this work, but have felt in their hearts to sustain it and to say that they gave not because they had not, but would gladly give if they had, let these same blessings rest down upon them also, and condescend to accept the desires of their hearts as free-will offerings unto Thee. Show favor unto all who have helped to forward this work by good wishes, good words or good deeds. Remember Thou and bless, we entreat Thee, the committee, and the architect and superintendent, and his assistant superintendent, and all the workmen and their foremen in every department who have labored in preparing the ground upon which the House stands, or the materials of which it is composed, or in constructing and bringing it to completion. Reward them, we ask Thee, for their faithfulness and diligence, and grant that the recollection of their labors may be a source of pleasure to them and their children after them.</p><p>O Lord God, who dwellest in the heaven of heavens, look down from Thy holy habitation, we beseech Thee, in great mercy and tender compassion upon Thy Zion which Thou hast founded. We turn to Thee with all our hearts for that help and succor which Thou alone canst give. We are beset with peril. We are surrounded with danger. The powers of evil are aroused against us. The foes of Thy Zion are numerous and mighty, while Thy people are but few and feeble. Floods of falsehood, slander and unjust accusations sweep over the land, concerning Thy Saints. By these means many of our fellow-citizens have been poisoned against us. They have urged the enactment of laws to ensnare us, to confiscate the property which we have constructed unto Thee, and to overflow the plan of salvation which Thou hast revealed to us. Through the delusion of lies and the binding effect of prejudice, our fellow-citizens would deny us our rights, would consign us to prison, would wrest from us our property, would threaten us with utter destruction.</p><p>Holy Father, Thou knowest how false are the accusations against us. We appeal to Thee for deliverance. Turn aside the wrath of man. Break the bands which encircle us. Destroy the traps which are spread for our feet. Let the light of eternal truth shine upon us and illumine our pathway. Vindicate us by Thy power, and let not the wicked aspersions of our enemies prevail. Show to the world, especially to our nation, the true character of Thy people. Enlighten the minds of the officers of our government, soften their hearts, and give them power to check all spirit of persecution and disposition to justify oppression and approve of unjust judgments. Help them to comprehend the true principles of liberty and to enforce the same for the benefit of all people throughout the land. Open their eyes to see the wrongs that are being committed against Thy people. Awaken them to a sense of justice. Give to the Chief Executive, to his cabinet and to the Congress and the courts of our nation, the firmness, courage and comprehension of justice necessary to maintain just and righteous government in the land, that all the people may rejoice.</p><p>Restrain and control the words and acts of preachers, lecturers and writers who endeavor to create anger and hostility against They people.

In their imprisonments, in their exile, in the unjust confiscation of their property and in the endurance of all the wrongs to which they are subjected, give them grace and patience and fortitude. May no murmuring at Thy providences ever escape their lips. Reveal to Thy people the salvation which awaits us.</p><p>O God, before Thee in this Thy Holy House, do we this day confess our sins. We acknowledge our shortcomings and imperfections. We are full of faults and errors. We accept the afflictions which we are now enduring as being permitted by Thee to make us more worthy of our high calling. We humbly pray Thee to forgive us. Blot out our transgressions, that they shall not appear against us any more. Condescend to let Thy favor and the light of Thy countenance rest upon us. Make known Thy will more and more plainly unto all Thy Saints. Uphold us in all righteousness as the people whom Thou hast chosen. Suffer us not to be put to shame; but show the inhabitants of the earth the truth of our testimony concerning Thee and Thy work.</p><p>Now, Holy Father, we ask Thee in the name of Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, to hear and answer this our prayer. We entreat Thee to accept this dedication of this House. Sanctify it and make it holy. The ordinances performed therein by Thy servants and handmaids, may they be in Thy sight as though performed by Thyself.</p><p>And to Thy name be the honor and glory and praise for ever and ever, through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Amen.</p>",

    "nauvoo": "<p>Almighty God, we come unto Thee in solemn and reverent prayer in the name of Thy Beloved Son, our Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>On this same site in the year 1841, Thy people, under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and in obedience to revelation from Thee, began construction of a temple to the Most High. They spared nothing in their efforts. They used the best materials, and with great skill and in a spirit of consecration, they labored through the years. Even when their Prophet and Patriarch were murdered by the ruthless mob in Carthage, the work on this structure continued. So did persecution against them. Denied the protection of the law and left to the mercy of the mob, they knew they would be forced to abandon their homes, their farms, and their city. Nonetheless, they determined to complete the temple.</p><p>They did so, and in that holy house ordinances dealing with the things of eternity, as revealed from Thee, were administered to thousands. They then left Nauvoo in bitter winter weather, many of them crossing the Mississippi on the ice, bound for a place of asylum somewhere in the West.</p><p>Thou knowest, dear Father, of the travails of those who made that long journey. Many died and were buried along that trail of tears. Great was their suffering, tremendous their courage.</p><p>We thank Thee that those harsh days are now long past. We thank Thee for this season in which we live, with the many blessings of peace and prosperity which we enjoy at Thy hands. Thy Spirit has brooded over us and moved upon us, and in obedience to its prompting we have now reconstructed on this hallowed ground the temple that once stood here. Through the tithes of Thy people and the generosity of faithful Saints there has been brought together all of the elements and the necessary skills to create this magnificent structure.</p><p>And now, acting in the authority of the divine priesthood which comes from Thee, and in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, we dedicate and consecrate unto Thee and unto Him this the Nauvoo Illinois Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p>We dedicate the ground on which it stands with its beautiful vegetation, the footings, the foundation, the walls and the tower with its bell, all surmounted by the figure of Moroni. We dedicate the magnificent baptistry, the areas for the initiatory ordinances, the endowment rooms, the beautiful celestial room, the sealing rooms and their sacred altars. We dedicate every space and facility in this wonderful structure.</p><p>Brought together in splendid harmony are the stones of the walls, the carefully crafted woods, the decorative murals and other paintings, the drapes and carpets, the elegant windows and many other unique and beautiful features. The entire structure has become a treasured work of art.</p><p>We pray that Thou wilt accept of this our offering. The hearts of the children have literally turned to those fathers who worked on the original building. They have done so with love and a wonderful spirit of consecrated effort.</p><p>Now, Beloved Father, this is Thy house, the gift of Thy thankful Saints. We pray that Thou wilt visit it. Hallow it with Thy presence and that of Thy Beloved Son. Let Thy Holy Spirit dwell here at all times. May Thy work be accomplished here, and Thine eternal purposes brought to pass in behalf of Thy children, both the living and the dead. May our hearts reach to Thee as we serve within these walls. May all who are baptized in behalf of those beyond the veil of death know that they are doing something necessary under Thine eternal plan. May those who are here endowed understand and realize the magnitude of the blessings that come of this sacred ordinance. Seal upon them the covenants which they make with Thee. Open their eyes to a clear perception of Thy divine purposes. As they move into the beautiful celestial room, may their minds be brought to an understanding of Thy glorious plan for the salvation and exaltation of Thy children.</p><p>May those who gather at the altars in the sealing rooms, whether in their own behalf or in behalf of their forebears, comprehend by the power of the Spirit Thy divine will concerning the eternity of the family\u2014fathers, mothers, and children, joined together in an everlasting union. May they receive a vision of Thine infinite \"plan of happiness\" which Thou hast designed for Thy faithful sons and daughters.</p><p>May all who come within these hallowed walls be worthy to enter into Thy presence. Save this structure from desecration of any kind. May it stand immaculate with \"holiness to the Lord.\" Strike down the evil hand of any who may seek to injure or destroy. Preserve this Thy house from the storms of nature and destructive elements of all kinds.</p><p>We pray for the temple presidency and the matron and her assistants. May they be blessed with strength and energy to carry forward their heavy responsibilities. Bless all who serve with them as workers that they may find great joy in their labors. May those who come as patrons walk reverently before Thee and be brought to a knowledge of Thy will and Thy ways.</p><p>We pray for those whom Thou hast appointed to stand in responsibilities of leadership in Thy Church and kingdom. Reveal unto Thy servant Thy will and bless him and his associates that all may work together for the accomplishment of Thy purposes.</p><p>Bless Thy cause throughout all the earth. We invoke Thy blessings upon Thy people wherever they may be.</p><p>As was said in Kirtland: \"Remember all thy church, O Lord, with all their families, and all their immediate connections, with all their sick and afflicted ones, with all the poor and meek of the earth; that the kingdom, which thou hast set up without hands, may become a great mountain and fill the whole earth;</p><p>\"That thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners;</p><p>\"And be adorned as a bride for that day when thou shalt unveil the heavens, and cause the mountains to flow down at thy presence, and the valleys to be exalted, the rough places made smooth; that thy glory may fill the earth\" (D&amp;C; 109:72-74).</p><p>Father dear, bless this land that those who govern shall never trample the rights of the people as was once done in Nauvoo. May liberty and peace be maintained under the banner of the Constitution, which Thou hast caused to be established \"for the rights and protection of all flesh\" (D&amp;C; 101:77). Bless this city of Nauvoo, which came to be known as the City of Joseph. May it shine with a renewed luster as the home of a Temple of God. May this sacred house stand as a memorial to him who lived here and was buried here, Joseph Smith, the great prophet of this dispensation, and his brother Hyrum, whom he loved.</p><p>We love Thee, Father. We love Thy Beloved Son. Smile with favor upon us. Strengthen our resolve to walk acceptably before Thee at all times. Increase our dedication to Thy will. Keep ever bright in our memories the solemn covenants into which we have entered with Thee. May Thy blessings attend us, and all who seek to live Thy commandments.</p><p>Praise be to Thee, Thou great Elohim, Thou who dwellest in the heavens and governeth the universe. Thou art our Father and our God, to whom we may come in prayer. To Thee we lift our voices in adoration and worship.</p><p>Increase our love for Thine Only Begotten Son, our Redeemer who has snatched us from the jaws of death and opened before us the wonders of eternity. Accept this our prayer, we ask Thee in His holy name, even the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>",

Bless the temple president and his counselors, the matron and her assistants, and those who will succeed them, that they may have strength and energy to carry forward the sacred work which will be done herein. May the youth of this temple district come with rejoicing for the great opportunity to serve in behalf of the dead. May such service build within them a testimony of the truth of this Thy great latter-day work, and fortify them against the wiles of the adversary and the beckoning ways of the world. May they grow in faith and testimony and love for the Thee and Thy Son.</p><p>We pray that in this temple district the hearts of the children may be turned to their fathers to search out the records of the past and then to act in behalf of those who have passed beyond and now await the redeeming work that will be carried forward in this, Thy house. May faith increase in the hearts of all of Thy people in this part of Thy vineyard.</p><p>We pray for all who serve in positions of responsibility, in stake presidencies, bishoprics, quorum presidencies, presidencies of the auxiliary organizations, as mission presidents and missionaries, and in any other capacity to which they have been called.</p><p>May the presence of this beautiful structure lead to interest and desire on the part of those who are not members of Thy Church, that they may be led to inquire and learn the truths of the everlasting gospel.</p><p>We pray for Thy Saints throughout the world.

We acknowledge our dependence upon Thee and pray that Thou wilt direct us in all that we do, that we may strengthen Thy work and build Thy kingdom all to Thy glory and to the glory of Thy Beloved Son, through whose atoning sacrifice we may be redeemed.

May the Spirit that prompted them to give, to serve, be with them throughout their lives, for only by service may they obtain that happiness which passeth understanding.</p><p>Our Father, we pray Thee to bless all those who have labored in the erection of this temple, or who have, in any way, by their means or influence, aided in its completion.  May peace abide in the homes of Thy people everywhere, and may sickness and disease be rebuked from their midst.</p><p>May each contributor be comforted in spirit and prospered a hundredfold!  May all be assured that they have the gratitude of thousands, perhaps millions, on the other side for whom the prison doors may now be opened and deliverance proclaimed to those who will accept the truth and be set free.</p><p>While his body lay in the tomb, Christ, Thy Beloved Son, preached to the spirits in prison who once were disobedient in the days of Noah, thus evidencing that those who have passed beyond the veil must also hear the word of God and obey the eternal principles of life and salvation.</p><p>Temples are built to Thy holy name as a means of uniting Thy people, living and dead, in bonds of faith, of peace, and of love throughout eternity.</p><p>Help all, O Father, to realize more keenly and sincerely than ever before that only by obedience to eternal principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ may loved ones who died without baptism be permitted the glorious privilege of entrance into Thy kingdom.

Let humility temper their feelings, wisdom and kind consideration guide their actions.  May they, and others who will be appointed as assistants, sealers, and custodians, maintain an atmosphere of cleanliness and holiness in every room.  Let no unclean person or thing ever enter herein, for \"my spirit,\" saith the Lord, \"will not dwell in unclean tabernacles\"; neither will it remain in a house where selfish, arrogant, or unwholesome thoughts abide.  Therefore, may all who seek this holy temple come with clean hands and pure hearts, that Thy Holy Spirit may ever be present to comfort, to inspire, and to bless.  May all who come within these sacred walls feel a peaceful, hallowed influence.  Cause, O Lord, that even people who pass the grounds, or view the temple from afar, may lift their eyes from groveling things of sordid life and look up to Thee and Thy providence.</p><p>Now, O God, our Heavenly Eternal Father, the faithful membership of Thy Church through love for Thee and Thy children, have erected to Thee by tithes and offerings this holy house in which shall be performed ordinances and ceremonies essential to the happiness, salvation, and exaltation of Thy children living in mortality and in the spirit world.  Accept of our offering, hallow it by Thy Holy Spirit, and protect and guard it by Thy power.</p><p>With this prayer we dedicate our lives to the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth for the peace of the world and to Thy glory forever, in the name of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>",

Accept of our thanks and of our love we humbly ask thee. We ask that Thy Holy Spirit distill upon us and bring peace and love into our hearts, all of which we humbly ask in the name of the Redeemer of the world, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>", 
    "ogden": "<p>Our Father who art in heaven, even the God of our fathers, who keepeth covenants and showest mercy; thou Almighty Elohim who liveth and reigneth, from everlasting to everlasting; thou Man of Holiness and Man of Counsel who hast created us in thine own image and likeness and commanded us to worship thee in spirit and in truth; thou who knoweth all things and hast all power, all might, and all dominion\u2014hallowed be thy great and holy name!</p><p>We come before thee in the name of thine Only Begotten Son, even him through whom salvation cometh; him whom thou hast appointed to be our Advocate with thee; and we plead the cleansing power of his atoning blood. Wilt thou, O Lord, listen to him and give heed to his words, as he speaks, saying:</p><p>\"Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.\"</p><p>Father, we have in our hearts the spirit of praise and thanksgiving and worship.

We thank thee, our Creator, for life and being and for the privilege of receiving our mortal probation in a day when thou hast revealed anew the terms and conditions of thy eternal plan of salvation.</p><p>We thank thee for the infinite wisdom and love manifest in the atoning sacrifice of thy Son. We are grateful that thou hast poured out upon us thy Holy Spirit, so that we can come to a perfect knowledge of the truth; so that we may be born again and be alive in Christ; so that we may cleanse and perfect our souls and stand spotless before thee at the last day.</p><p>O God, our Heavenly Father, we have no words to express our gratitude to thee for all thou hast done for us and for all mankind. Hallowed be thy name forever! And may we worship thee in spirit and in truth and signify our love for thee and thy work by keeping thy commandments!</p><p>Unto thee we raise our voices in thanksgiving for the lives and ministries of the Prophet Joseph Smith, of Hyrum Smith the Patriarch, and of the prophets and apostles and righteous men and women who have built on the foundation they laid. We rejoice in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon; in the revelations that bespeak thy mind and will; in the ministry among us of holy angels sent of thee to confer power and priesthood and keys upon men; in thy personal appearance and that of thy Son to usher in this final, great gospel dispensation; and in the outpouring of thy Holy Spirit, which reveals thy mind and will to us constantly. O Lord our God, unto thee we sing songs of praise and thanksgiving by day and by night!</p><p>It pleases us that in this our day thou didst send Elijah the prophet, before the second coming of thy Son, to reveal that priesthood and confer those keys whereby thy children may be sealed up unto eternal life. We thank thee that the hearts of the children are now turning to their fathers, and that the ordinances of salvation and exaltation are now being performed in thy holy temples for both the living and the dead.</p><p>Our hearts rejoice, we are exceedingly glad, and the earth breaks forth into singing as we seem to hear \"the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.\"</p><p>We rejoice, O Lord, in thy infinite mercy whereby thou dost make available thy saving truths to the living and the dead, so that those who die without a knowledge of thee and thy Son, but who would have received his gospel with all their hearts, had they heard it in the flesh, may be heirs of the celestial kingdom.</p><p>We thank thee that from time to time thou dost part the veil and let thy servants on earth behold the ministries and labors of their fellow servants in the paradise of God; that thy servant President Joseph F. smith \"saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great\"; and also \"an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality\"; and that he saw \"the Son of God\" appear to them, \"declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful\"; and that there the Son \"preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from individual sins on conditions of repentance.\"</p><p>And now our Father, we thank thee for thy direction in building temples wherein the blessings of baptism and of celestial marriage and of eternal life may be made available to the living and the dead.

Wilt thou preserve those who are and shall take thy message to the world. Keep them free from sin and steadfast in their desires to be living witnesses of thy great latter-day work.</p><p>Wilt thou, O Lord, remember thy covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob concerning their seed; and with Lehi and Nephi and thy \"other sheep\" on the American continent; that their descendants should have the blessings of the gospel, \"which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal.\" Cause that the scattered remnants of thine ancient chosen people may open their hearts to the message of those living prophets whom thou dost now send to them.</p><p>Let thy servants speak as with thy voice in inviting thy chosen ones to forsake the world and come out of darkness into the marvelous light of thy Son. Let them say: \"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\"</p><p>O let success attend thy work in all its parts; and let thy kingdom roll forth, as the stone cut from the mountain without hands, until it breaks in pieces all other kingdoms and fills the whole earth!</p><p>And hasten the day, O Lord of Hosts, when the scattered remnants of Judah, after their pain, shall be sanctified in holiness before thee and shall build again the waste places of Jerusalem, that they may once again be numbered with thy people; that the promises may be fulfilled, \"for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\"</p><p>As thou knowest, O our God, we are living in the last days when the signs of the times are being shown forth; when thou art hastening thy work in its time; and when we have already heard the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord and make his paths straight.</p><p>We have received thy messenger, even the messenger of the covenant, who has brought again thy everlasting gospel, to be a light to the world and a standard for thy people. And it is our desire to be instruments in thy hands to prepare a people for the coming of thy Son; for the day when every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; for the day when the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and he shall stand again on earth; for the day when thy saints shall be redeemed, and \"shall mention the loving kindness of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his goodness, and according to his loving kindness, forever and ever.\"</p><p>O, our Father, we long for the day when the Prince of Peace shall come, when the earth shall rest and righteousness be found again upon her face; and it is our prayer, spoken out of humble and contrite hearts, that we shall abide the day and be found worthy to live with him whom thou hast appointed to stand as King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom be glory and honor and power and might both now and forever.</p><p>Wilt thou strengthen us in our desires to keep thy commandments and overcome the world, to be living witnesses of the truth and divinity of thy work, and to stand valiantly in bearing testimony of those things which we have received. We desire to bridle our passions, to control our appetites, and to rise above the lusts of the flesh and the evil and carnality that is everywhere to be found. We desire righteousness. We are thy people; pour out thy Spirit upon us.</p><p>O Lord, wilt thou bless us and keep us, and make thy face to shine upon us, and give us peace. These are our desires, and thou hast said that thou wilt grant unto the children of men according to their desires, and we now call upon thee in faith and unity to fulfill thy promises and grant us the desires of our hearts in righteousness.</p><p>We desire, above all things, to be saved in thy kingdom, for we know \"there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation,\" and that salvation consists in becoming perfect as thou and thy Son are perfect and in the continuation of the family unit in eternity.</p><p>And so, O God our Heavenly and Eternal Father, we pray that we may perfect our families. Wilt thou cause that husbands and wives in Israel shall love each other and cleave unto their eternal companions and none else. Wilt thou guide parents in Zion in bringing up their children in light and in truth, that our children, who are also thy children, shall stand firm in the faith forever. Wilt thou pour out upon the young and rising generation the spirit of obedience and conformity that they may be led to honor their fathers and their mothers as thou didst command by the mouths of Moses and others of thy servants.</p><p>Let not the choice spirits whom thou hast sent to earth in the lineage of thy friend, Abraham our father, be led in paths where they transgress thy laws \"and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin.\" O may the spirit of love and of unity, of service and of righteousness be in the homes of all Israel, that thy chosen people may truly be as a city set on an hill whose light cannot be hid.</p><p>We are grateful beyond any measure of expression for thy goodness and grace and for all thou hast done for us. We acknowledge thy hand in all things. We have no desires but to serve thee and keep thy commandments, to worship thee in spirit and in truth, so that we may enjoy the companionship of thy Holy Spirit in this life and dwell with thee in thy kingdom when our labors here are completed.</p><p>\"How glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!\"</p><p>O \"That our garments may be pure, that we may be clothed upon with robes of righteousness, with palms in our hands, and crowns of glory upon our heads, and reap eternal joy for all our sufferings.</p><p>\"O Lord God Almighty, hear us in these our petitions, and answer us from heaven, thy holy habitation, where thou sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, power, majesty, might, dominion, truth, justice, judgment, mercy, and an infinity of fulness, from everlasting to everlasting.\"</p><p>And now, O God, the Eternal Father, accept from our mouths these words of praise and thanksgiving and petition. Hear our cries; read the thoughts and intents of our hearts; and be pleased to grant us all that we need without our multiplying words before thee.

This wondrous event parted the curtain that had been closed for centuries. This marvelous appearance, which is the foundation of Thy work in this dispensation, brought back to earth a knowledge of the one true God and the resurrected Lord. Wonderful are the words of the boy Joseph in his description of this transcendent event: \"When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is my Beloved Son. Hear Him!\" (Joseph Smith-History 1:17).</p><p>That marvelous theophany, unequaled since the events on the Mount of Transfiguration two millennia ago, became the introduction to Thy work in this the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p><p>Following that came the Book of Mormon. In this same vicinity, Joseph received the plates from the hands of Moroni, and there ensued their translation into the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ, which was published here in Palmyra.</p><p>The restoration of the priesthood followed and the bestowal of necessary keys came after that, that the fulness of the priesthood might be upon the earth together with the authority to organize Thy Church and establish it upon a foundation that will stand through time and all eternity.</p><p>Dear Father, we acknowledge that it all began here.

We thank thee, dear Father, for all who have gone before us to make this occasion possible.  We look back with appreciation to the Prophet Joseph Smith to whom Thou didst reveal Thyself with Thy Son, and who became the instrument in Thy hands in the opening of this, the dispensation of the Fulness of Times.  It was to him that Thou didst reveal the need for and the purpose of such temples as we dedicate this day.

We thank thee for the atoning sacrifice of thy Beloved Son; that he came into the world to die upon the cross for the sins of the world; that he has ransomed us from temporal and spiritual death; that by his stripes we are healed. And we covenant before thee to walk in the light of revealed truth so that we may have joyous fellowship one with another and so that the blood of Jesus Christ, thy Son, may cleanse us from all sin.</p><p>And so now, with thy grace attending, may we shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel and say: O Jehovah, thou God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; thou who \"wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation\"; thou who shalt make us \"unto our God kings and priests\" that we may live with thee a thousand years, thou art \"worthy \u2026 to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.\"</p><p>And may we, O God, our Heavenly Father, be numbered everlastingly with that mighty congregation of the righteous which acclaims with one voice: \"Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.\"</p><p>Our Father, we have no power of expression to ascribe unto thee the gratitude in our hearts for thy love and mercy and condescension unto us thy children. We are overwhelmed by thy grace and goodness in sending thine Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him might have eternal life; and we rejoice and praise thee for restoring in this dispensation, through thy servant Joseph Smith, Jr., the fullness of thine everlasting gospel.</p><p>We thank thee that thou didst appear with thy Beloved Son in the spring of 1820 to usher in this final gospel dispensation; that thereafter thou didst send Moroni to reveal the Book of Mormon; that John the Baptist, and Peter, James, and John ministered to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; that Moses and Elijah and Elias and Gabriel and Raphael and divers angels came from the courts of glory, \"all declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept,\" until the whole plan of salvation, in all its beauty and glory, is now again on earth.</p><p>O Lord, we thank thee for the saving truths revealed anew in our day and for the noble and great spirits sent to earth to carry forward thy great work in these last days. We rejoice in the mission and ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, who together held the keys of this final dispensation and who sealed their testimony with their blood. We thank thee for the faith and devotion of all those who have worn the prophetic mantle, and of all thy faithful saints, and we pray for strength to be even as they are.</p><p>We thank thee that thou didst reveal unto us thy priesthood, even the sealing power, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, so that in this temple and all thy other holy houses thy faithful saints may be endowed with power from on high and may enter into those everlasting covenants which open the door to the receipt of all of the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the holy prophets.</p><p>O our Father, we seek to be like thee; we seek to pattern our lives after the life of thy Son; we desire righteousness for ourselves and our children and our children\u2019s children; we turn our faces to this holy house; and we plead with thee to make us worthy to inherit the fullness of those blessings found only in thy holy temples, even those blessings which grow out of the continuation of the family unit forever.</p><p>Thou knowest, O Father, that we seek these blessings, not only for ourselves and our descendants, but also for our forebears; for thou hast said that we, as saviors on Mount Zion, have power to save and redeem our worthy dead. We seek so to do, and we plead for thy guidance and directing light as we go forward in this work\u2014one of the greatest ever revealed to the children of men in any age of the earth.</p><p>We look forward to the day, O our God, when thou wilt reveal unto thy servants where other temples shall be built in all the nations where thy saints increase in numbers and serve thee in righteousness. We know that all men are thy children, and we pray for the day when all who will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely and gain for themselves the fullness of the blessings that thou hast in store for all those who love and serve thee with all their hearts.</p><p>Incline thine ear, O Lord; look down upon us in mercy; hear us in these our petitions; and grant us the desires of our hearts in righteousness, as we plead with thee for the welfare of Zion and all her interests and concerns.

May thy kingdom, which is thy church, \"go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that thine enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory, forever and ever.\"</p><p>O God, our Father, in this day of turmoil and evil, when Satan has power over his own dominion and when his forces seek to destroy thy work, we are strengthened and comforted and given courage by thy decree that thy Son \"shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst.\" And we testify before thee that we know that he does reign in our midst, for which blessing we praise thy holy name forever.</p><p>We remember with soberness and subdued souls thy promise that no weapon that is formed against thy saints shall prosper; and that if any man lift his voice against them, he shall be confounded in thine own due time.</p><p>We thank thee, O our God, that thou didst ordain and establish the Constitution of the United States by the hands of wise men whom thou didst raise up unto this very purpose. We thank thee for the freedoms and rights and privileges which are guaranteed to us in this sacred document and pray that they may be established forever. We beseech thee to put into the heart of the chief executive of this nation the desire and determination to preserve our free institutions for us and our posterity. Wilt thou bless the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of our government, that each may function wisely and courageously in its respective field, for the preservation of our constitutional form of government.</p><p>Now, O Father, thy faithful saints are and shall be in all the nations of the earth. We have deep concern for their temporal and spiritual well-being. We pray that the rulers of all people, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, may be constrained to adopt forms of government which will assure to all men those freedoms which rightly belong to them and which are justifiable before thee.</p><p>Wilt thou, O Lord, put into the hearts of thy saints everywhere a desire and a determination to follow implicitly the declaration, \"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.\" May they strive to further the cause of righteousness by the election to office of good and righteous men, and to \"be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet.\"</p><p>Our souls are troubled and we weep because of the wickedness of the world and the evils that abound on every hand. Out of deep concern, therefore, we pray for the youth of Zion, for the young and rising generation, for those who must now prepare themselves to bear up the kingdom in their time and season. Keep them from evil; hedge up the way so they may not fall into sin and be overcome by the world. O Lord, bless the youth of Zion and us their leaders that we may guide and direct them aright.</p><p>We know that thy kingdom shall roll onward and that hosts of the young and rising generation shall yet stand forth in power and great glory as witnesses of thy name and teachers of thy law. Preserve them, O our God; enlighten their minds and pour out upon them thy Holy Spirit, as they prepare for the great work that shall rest upon them.</p><p>Let that great temple of learning, the Brigham Young University, and all that is associated with it, and all other Church schools, institutes, and seminaries be prospered to the full. Let thy enlightening power rest upon those who teach and those who are taught, that they may \"seek learning, even by study and also by faith.\"</p><p>Bless us, O Lord, that we may \"teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom,\" as thou hast commanded. May we do so with such diligence that thy holy grace shall attend, so that we may \"be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God.\"</p><p>May those who teach and study in all academic fields have their souls enlightened with spiritual knowledge so they will turn to thy house for blessings and knowledge and learning that surpass all that may be found elsewhere.</p><p>We are grateful, O our Father, that it is thy purpose to provide for thy saints and are mindful of the command thou hast given us to care for the needy and unfortunate among them. We know thou hast commanded us and all men to subdue the earth and to earn our bread in the sweat of our face, but our hearts go out to those among us who have been overtaken by misfortune and who are not able at all times to care for their own needs.</p><p>We are most grateful, therefore, that thou didst inspire thy servants to institute the welfare program of thy church so that the poor and unfortunate may be provided for without the forfeiture of their self-respect. And now, with the rapidly expanding number of stakes and missions throughout the world, we earnestly pray that thy servants may continue in thy favor, that they may merit thy inspiration to develop this welfare program of thy church until it becomes perfect in all respects, for the care and blessing of thy people wherever they may be gathered together.</p><p>We seek thy guidance and Spirit, O Holy Father, so that thy saints may be cared for in thine own way. We desire to follow those principles thou hast given, which are: that those who are in distress shall use their own individual efforts to the full; that those who are rich in wisdom, in leadership, and in the material things of the world shall contribute of their talents and means; that all of us shall unite together in the bonds of true brotherhood in caring for the fatherless and the widows; and that we shall keep ourselves unspotted from the sins of the world\u2014all of which, as thou hast said, is pure religion and undefiled before thy holy face. O Lord, bless thy servants with revelation in this and all things pertaining to the growth and development of thy work on earth.</p><p>And now, O God, the Eternal Father, accept from our mouths these words of praise and thanksgiving and petition. Hear our cries; read the thoughts and intents of our hearts; and be pleased to grant us all that we need. We acknowledge thy hand in all things and desire to serve thee and keep thy commandments, that we may have place with thee in thy kingdom.</p><p>It has been our privilege, as guided by the whisperings of thy Spirit, to build unto thee this temple, which we now present unto thee as another of thy holy houses.</p><p>Wherefore, according to the pattern thou hast given, and in harmony with the course pursued by thy servants who have been before, and acting in the authority of that priesthood which is after the order of thy Son and in his holy name, we dedicate this temple to thee, the Lord.</p><p>We dedicate it as a house of baptism, a house of endowment, a house of marriage, a house of righteousness for the living and the dead.</p><p>We humbly pray that thou wilt accept this edifice and pour out thy blessings upon it as a house to which thou wilt come and in which thy Spirit will direct all that is done, that it may be accepted unto thee. Let thy Spirit and blessings attend and guide all who officiate herein, that a feeling of holiness will prevail in every room of this, thy holy house. May all who enter have clean hands and pure hearts, and may they be built up in their faith and depart with a feeling of peace and praising thy holy name.</p><p>We dedicate the grounds on which it stands and which surround it. We dedicate the font and ordinance rooms and especially the sealing rooms, that they may be kept holy and that thy protecting care may be over them, and that thy Spirit may ever be present to enlighten those who attend.</p><p>We dedicate all the structural parts from its foundation to the tower. Protect it, we pray thee, from any devastating influence, holocausts, hurricanes, storms, or destruction of any kind.</p><p>We dedicate the walks, the ornamental landscaping, the trees, plants, flowers, and shrubbery which will subsequently be added. May they add beauty and give fragrance to the surroundings.</p><p>Protect all the mechanical parts to the end that there might be a harmonious operation of this holy temple from day to day.</p><p>May all that is done herein be with an eye single to thy glory and to the building up of thy kingdom here upon the earth.</p><p>And now finally, we dedicate this temple as an abode for thee and thy Son and thy Holy Spirit and ask that thou wilt place thy ratifying seal of approval upon this dedicatory ordinance and upon all that we have done and shall do in this, thy holy house, which we now give unto thee, the Lord.</p><p>O Lord God of our fathers, who sitteth upon thy throne, and who liveth and reigneth over all things, blessed be thy holy name both now and forever!</p><p>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, thine only Son, even so.

And may it graciously please Thee to hearken unto our petitions, answer them according to Thine infinite wisdom and love, and grant that the blessings which we seek may be bestowed upon us, even a hundred fold, inasmuch as we seek with purity of heart and fullness of purpose to do Thy will and glorify Thy name.</p><p>We thank Thee, O Thou Great Eloheim, that Thou didst raise up Thy servant, Joseph Smith through the loins of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and made him a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and through the assistance and administrations of angels from heaven, Thou didst enable him to bring forth the Book of Mormon, the stick of Joseph, in the hand of Ephraim, in fulfillment of the prophecies of Isaiah and other prophets, which record has been translated and published in many languages. We also thank Thee, our Father in heaven, that Thou didst inspire Thy servant and give him power on the earth to organize Thy Church in this goodly land, in all its fullness, power and glory, with Apostles, Prophets, Pastors and Teachers, with all the gifts and graces belonging thereto, and all this by the power of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood, which Thou didst bestow upon him by the administration of holy angels, who held that Priesthood in the days of the Savior. We thank Thee, our God, that Thou didst enable Thy servant Joseph to build two temples, in which ordinances were administered for the living and the dead; that he also lived to send the gospel to the nations of the earth and to the islands of the sea, and labored exceedingly until he was martyred for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p><p>We also thank Thee, O our Father in heaven, that Thou didst raise up Thy servant Brigham Young, who held the keys of the Priesthood on the earth for many years, and who led Thy people to these valleys of the mountains, and laid the corner-stone of this great Temple and dedicated it unto Thee; and who did direct the building of three other temples in these Rocky Mountains which have been dedicated unto Thy holy name, in which temples many thousands of the living have been blessed and the dead redeemed.</p><p>Our Father in heaven, we are also thankful to Thee for Thy servant John Taylor, who followed in the footsteps of Thy servant Brigham, until he laid down his life in exile.</p><p>Thou hast called Thy servants Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith to hold the keys of the Presidency and priesthood this day, and for these shepherds of Thy flock we feel to give Thee thanksgiving and praise. Thy servant Wilford is bound to acknowledge Thy hand, O Father, in the preservation of his life from the hour of his birth to the present day. Nothing but Thy power could have preserved him through that which he has passed during the eighty-six years that Thou hast granted him life on the earth.</p><p>For the raising up of the Twelve Apostles, we also thank Thee, our God, and for the perfect union which exists among us.</p><p>We thank Thee, O Lord, for the perfect organizations of Thy Church as they exist at the present time.</p><p>O Lord, we regard with intense and indescribable feelings the completion of this sacred house. Deign to accept this the fourth temple which Thy covenant children have been assisted by Thee in erecting in these mountains. In past ages Thou didst inspire with Thy Holy Spirit Thy servants, the prophets, to speak of the time in the latter days when the mountain of the Lord's house should be established in the tops of the mountains, and should be exalted above the hills. We thank Thee that we have had the glorious opportunity of contributing to the fulfillment of these visions of Thine ancient seers, and that Thou hast condescended to permit us to take part in the great work. And as this portion of Thy servants' words has thus so marvelously been brought to pass, we pray Thee, with increased faith and renewed hope, that all their words with regard to Thy great work in gathering Thine Israel and building up Thy kingdom on earth in the last days may be as amply fulfilled, and that, O Lord, speedily.</p><p>We come before Thee with joy and thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and hearts filled with praise, that Thou hast permitted us to see this day for which, during these forty years, we have hoped, and toiled, and prayed, when we can dedicate unto Thee this house which we have built to Thy most glorious name. One year ago we set the capstone with shouts of Hosanna to God and the Lamb. And today we dedicate the whole unto Thee, with all that pertains unto it that it may be holy in Thy sight; that it may be a house of prayer, a house of praise and of worship; that Thy glory may rest upon it; that Thy holy presence may be continually in it; that it may be the abode of Thy Well-Beloved Son, our Savior; that the angels who stand before Thy face may be the hallowed messengers who shall visit it, bearing to us Thy wishes and Thy will, that it may be sanctified and consecrated in all its parts holy unto Thee, the God of Israel, the Almighty Ruler of Mankind. And we pray Thee that all people who may enter upon the threshold of this, Thine house, may feel Thy power and be constrained to acknowledge that Thou hast sanctified it, that it is Thy house, a place of Thy holiness.</p><p>We pray Thee, Heavenly Father, to accept this building in all its parts from foundation to capstone, with the statue that is on the latter placed, and all the finals and other ornaments that adorn its exterior. We pray Thee to bless, that they decay not, all the walls, partitions, floors, ceilings, roofs and bridging, the elevators, stairways, railings and steps, the frames, doors, windows, and other openings, all things connected with the lighting, heating, and sanitary apparatus, the boilers, engines, and dynamos, the connecting pipes and wires, the lamps and burners, and all utensils, furniture and articles used in or connected with the holy ordinances administered in this house, the veils and the altars, the baptismal font and the oxen on which it rests, and all that pertains thereto, the baths, washstands and basins. Also the safes and vaults in which the records are preserved, with the records themselves, and all books, documents, and papers appertaining to the office of the recorder, likewise the library with all the books, maps, instruments, etc., that may belong thereto. We also present before Thee, for Thine acceptance, all the additions and buildings not forming a part of the main edifice, but being appendages thereto; and we pray Thee to bless all the furniture, seats, cushions, curtains, hangings, locks, and fastenings, and multitudinous other appliances and appurtenances found in and belonging to this Temple and its annexes with all the work or ornamentation thereon, the painting and plastering, the gilding and bronzing, the fine work in wood and metal of every kind, the embroidery and needlework, the pictures and statuary, the carved work and canopies. Also the materials of which the buildings and their contents are made or composed\u2014the rock, lime, mortar and plaster, the timbers and lath, the wood of various trees, the gold and silver, the brass and iron, and all other metals, the silk, wool, and cotton, the skins and furs, the glass, china, and precious stones, all these and all else herein we humbly present for Thine acceptance and sanctifying blessing.</p><p>Our Father in heaven, we present before Thee the altars which we have prepared for Thy servants and handmaidens to receive their sealing blessings. We dedicate them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, unto Thy most holy name, and we ask Thee to sanctify these altars, that those who come unto them may feel the power of the Holy Ghost resting upon them, and realize the sacredness of the covenants they enter into. And we pray that our covenants and contracts which we make with Thee and with each other may be directed by Thy holy Spirit, be sacredly kept by us, and accepted by Thee, and that all the blessings pronounced may be realized by all Thy Saints who come to these altars, in the morning of the resurrection of the just.</p><p>O Lord, we pray Thee to bless and sanctify the whole of this block or piece of ground on which these buildings stand, with the surrounding walls and fences, the walks, paths and ornamental beds, also the trees, plants, flowers and shrubbery that grow in its soil; may they bloom and blossom and become exceedingly beautiful and fragrant; and may Thy Spirit dwell in the midst thereof, that this plot of ground may be a place of rest and peace, for holy meditation and inspired thought.</p><p>Preserve these buildings, we beseech Thee, from injury or destruction by flood or fire; from the rage of the elements, the shafts of the vivid lightning, the overwhelming blasts of the hurricane, the flames of consuming fire, and the upheavals of the earth-quake, O Lord, protect them.</p><p>Bless, we pray Thee, Heavenly Father, all who may be workers in this house. Remember continually Thy servant who shall be appointed to preside within its walls; endow him richly with wisdom of the Holy Ones, with the spirit of his calling, with the power of his Priesthood, and with the gift of discernment. Bless, according to their calling, his assistants and all who are associated with him in the performance of the ordinances\u2014baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings, sealings, endowments, and ordinations which are performed herein, that all that is done may be holy and acceptable unto Thee, Thou God of our salvation. Bless the recorders and copyists, that the records of the Temple may be kept perfect, and without omission and errors, and that they may also be accepted of Thee. Bless, in their several positions, the engineers, watchmen, guards, and all others who have duties to perform in connection with the house, that they may perform them unto Thee with an eye single to Thy glory.</p><p>Remember also in Thy mercy all those who have labored in the erection of this house, or who have, in any way, by their means or influence aided in its completion; may they in no wise lose their reward.</p><p>O Thou God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose God Thou delightest to be called, we thank Thee with all the fervor of overflowing gratitude that Thou hast revealed the powers by which the hearts of the children are being turned to their fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children, that the sons of men, in all their generations can be made partakers of the glories and joys of the kingdom of heaven. Confirm upon us the spirit of Elijah, we pray Thee, that we may thus redeem our dead and also connect ourselves with our fathers who have passed behind the veil, and furthermore seal up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection, that we who dwell on the earth may be bound to those who dwell in heaven. We thank Thee for their sake who have finished their work in mortality, as well as for our own, that the prison doors have been opened, that deliverance has been proclaimed to the captive, and the bonds have been loosened from those who were bound. We praise Thee that our fathers, from last to first, from now, back to the beginning, can be united with us in indissoluble links, welded by the Holy Priesthood, and that as one great family united in Thee and cemented by Thy power we shall together stand before Thee, and by the power of the atoning blood of Thy Son be delivered from all evil, be saved and sanctified, exalted and glorified. Wilt Thou also permit holy messengers to visit us within these sacred walls and make known unto us with regard to the work we should perform in behalf of our dead. And, as Thou has inclined the hearts of many who have not yet entered into covenant with Thee to search out their progenitors, and in so doing they have traced the ancestry of many of Thy Saints, we pray Thee that Thou wilt increase this desire in their bosoms, that they may in this way aid in the accomplishment of Thy work. Bless them, we pray Thee, in their labors, that they may not fall into errors in preparing their genealogies; and furthermore, we ask Thee to open before them new avenues of information, and place in their hands the records of the past, that their work may not only be correct but complete also.</p><p>O Thou Great Father of the spirits of all flesh, graciously bless and fully qualify those upon whom Thou hast placed a portion of Thine authority, and who bear the responsibilities and powers of the priesthood which is after the order of Thy Son. Bless them all from first to last from Thy servant who represents Thee in all the world to the latest who has been ordained to the Deacon's office. Upon each and all confer the spirit of their calling, with a comprehension of its duties and a loving zeal to fulfill them. Endow them with faith, patience and understanding. May their lives be strong in virtue and adorned with humility; may their ministrations be effectual, their prayers be availing and their teachings the path of salvation. May they be united by the Spirit and power of God in all their labors, and in every thought, word and act, may they glorify Thy name and vindicate the wisdom that has made them kings and priests unto Thee.</p><p>For Thy servants of the First Presidency of the Church we first of all pray. Reveal, in great clearness, Thy mind and will unto them in all things essential for the welfare of Thy people; give them heavenly wisdom, abounding faith, and the power and gifts necessary to enable them to preside acceptably unto Thee over the officers and members of Thy Church. Remember in love Thy servant whom Thou hast called to be a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator to all mankind, whose days have been many upon the earth; yet lengthen out his span of mortal life, we pray Thee, and grant unto him all the powers and gifts, in their completeness, of the office Thou hast conferred upon him; and in like manner bless his associates in the Presidency of Thy Church.</p><p>Confer upon Thy servants, the Twelve Apostles, a rich endowment of Thy Spirit. Under their guidance may the gospel of the kingdom go forth into all the world, to be preached to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that the honest in heart in every land may hear the glad tidings of joy and salvation. Overrule, we pray Thee, in the midst of the governments of the earth, that the barriers that now stand in the way of the spread of Thy truths may be removed, and liberty of conscience be accorded to all peoples.</p><p>Remember in loving kindness Thy servants, the Patriarchs. May they be full of blessings for Thy people Israel. May they bear with them the seeds of comfort and consolation, of encouragement and blessing. Fill them with the Holy Spirit of promise, and be graciously pleased to fulfill their words of prophecy, that Thy name may be extolled by the people of Thy Church and their faith in Thee and in the promises of Thy ministering servants be increasingly strengthened.</p><p>With Thy servants of the Twelve, bless their associates, the Seventies; may they be powerful in the preaching of Thy word and in bearing it to the four quarters of the earth. May an ever-widening way be opened before them until they shall have raised the gospel standard in every land and proclaimed its saving truths in every tongue, that all the islands and the continents may rejoice in the testimony of the great work Thou art in these later days performing on the earth.</p><p>Bless abundantly, O Lord, the High Priests in all the varied duties and positions to which Thou hast called them. As standing ministers of Thy word in the multiplying Stakes of Zion wilt Thou endow them richly with the spirit of their exalted callings. As Presidents, Counselors, Bishops, members of High Councils, and in every other office which their Priesthood gives them the right to fill may they be righteous ministers of Thy holy law, loving fathers of the people, and as judges in the midst of the Saints may they deal out just and impartial judgment tempered with mercy and love.</p><p>So also, in their various callings, confer precious gifts of wisdom, faith and knowledge upon Thy servants, the Elders, Priests, Teachers, and Deacons, that all may diligently perform their parts in the glorious labors Thou hast called Thy Priesthood to bear.</p><p>Forget not, we beseech Thee, Thy servants the missionaries, who are proclaiming the saving truths that Thou hast revealed for man's redemption to the millions who are now overshadowed by deep spiritual darkness. Preserve them from all evil, deliver them from mob violence, may they want no good thing, but be greatly blessed with the gifts and powers of their ministry. Remember also their families, that they may be sustained and comforted by Thee and be cherished and cared for by Thy Saints.</p><p>We pray Thee for the members of Thy Holy Church throughout all the world, that Thy people may be so guided and governed of Thee, that all who profess to be and call themselves Saints may be preserved in the unity of the faith, in the way of truth, in the bonds of peace, and in holiness of life. Strengthen the weak, we pray Thee, and impart Thy Spirit unto all.</p><p>Our Father, may peace abide in all the homes of Thy Saints; may holy angels guard them; may they be encompassed by Thine arms of love; may prosperity shine upon them, and may the tempter and the destroyer be removed far from them. May the days of Thy covenant people be lengthened out in righteousness, and sickness and disease be rebuked from their midst. May the land they inhabit be made fruitful by Thy grace, may its waters be increased and the climate be tempered to the comfort and need of Thy people; may drought, devastating storms, cyclones, and hurricanes be kept afar off, and earthquakes never disturb the land which Thou hast given us. May locusts, caterpillars and other insects not destroy our garden and desolate our fields; but may we be a people blessed of Thee in our bodies and spirits, in our homes and habitations, in our flocks and herds, in ourselves and our posterity, and in all that Thou hast made us stewards over.</p><p>Now we pray for the youth of Zion\u2014the children of Thy people; endow them richly with the spirit of faith and righteousness and with increasing love for Thee and for Thy law. Prosper all the institutions that Thou hast established in our midst for their well-being. Give to our Church Schools an ever-increasing power for good. May the Holy Spirit dominate the teachings given therein and also control the hearts and illumine the minds of the students. Bless marvelously Thy servants, the General Superintendent, and all the principals, teachers and other officers, and also those from the General Board of Education of Thy Church. Remember, likewise in Thy loving kindness the Sunday Schools, with all who, either as teachers or scholars, belong thereto; may the influence of the instruction given therein broaden and deepen, to Thy glory and the salvation of Thy children, until the perfect day. Bless the members of the General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union with the wisdom necessary for the proper fulfillment of their duties, and for the accomplishment of the purposes for which this board was created.</p><p>We also uphold before Thee the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, with all their officers, general and local, and the members. May they be prospered of Thee, their membership be enlarged, and the good that they accomplish increase with every succeeding year. For the Primaries and Religion Classes we also seek Thy constant blessing and guiding care; may the spirit of instruction be poured out upon the presidents and associate officers and the teachers. May they keep peace with the rest of the educational establishments in Thy Church; so that from their earliest years our children may be diligently brought up in the ways of the Lord, and Thy name be magnified in their growth in virtue and intelligence.</p><p>Nor would we forget, O Lord, the normal training classes among Thy people, whether these classes be connected with the Church Schools, the Improvement Associations, or the Sunday Schools. Grant that these classes may be the means of spreading true education throughout all the borders of the Saints by the creation of a body of teachers who will not only be possessed of rare intelligence but be filled also with the spirit of the gospel and be powerful in the testimony of Thy truth and in implanting a love for Thee and Thy works in the hearts of all whom they instruct.</p><p>We would hold up before Thee, O Lord, the Relief Societies, with all their members; and all those who preside in their midst according to their callings and appointments, general or local. Bless the Teachers in their labors of mercy and charity, who, as ministering angels, visit the homes of the sick and the needy, bearing succor, consolation and comfort to the unfortunate and sorrowful. And bless, we beseech Thee, most merciful Father, the poor of Thy people, that the cry of want and suffering may not ascend unto Thee from the midst of Thy Saints whom Thou hast blessed so abundantly with the comforts of this world. Open up new avenues by which the needy can obtain a livelihood by honest industry, and also incline the hearts of those blessed more abundantly, to give generously of their substance in this respect, less favored brethren and sisters, that Thou mayest not have reason to chide us for the neglect of even the least among Thy covenant children.</p><p>O God of Israel, turn Thy face, we pray Thee, in loving kindness toward Thy stricken people of the House of Judah. Oh, deliver them from those that oppress them. Heal up their wounds, comfort their hearts, strengthen their feet, and give them ministers after Thine own heart who shall lead them as of old, in Thy way. May the days of their tribulation soon cease, and they be planted by Thee in the valleys and plains of their ancient home; and may Jerusalem rejoice and Judea be glad for the multitude of her sons and daughters, for the sweet voices of children in her streets, and the rich outpouring of Thy saving mercies upon them. May Israel no more bow the head, or bend the neck to the oppressor, but may his feet be made strong on the everlasting hills, never more, by violence, to be banished therefrom, and the praise and the glory shall be Thine.</p><p>Remember in like pity the dwindling remnants of the House of Israel, descendants of Thy servant Lehi. Restore them we pray Thee, to Thine ancient favor, fulfill in their completeness the promises given to their fathers, and make of them a white and delightsome race, a loved and holy people as in former days. May the time also be nigh at hand when Thou wilt gather the dispersed of Israel from the islands of the sea and from every land in which Thou hast scattered them, and the ten tribes of Jacob from their hiding place in the north, and restore them to communion and fellowship with their kinsmen of the seed of Abraham.</p><p>We thank Thee, O God of Israel, that Thou didst raise up patriotic men to lay the foundation of this great American government. Thou didst inspire them to frame a good constitution and laws which guarantee to all of the inhabitants of the land equal rights and privileges to worship Thee according to the dictates of their own consciences. Bless the officers, both judicial and executive. Confer abundant favors upon the President, his Cabinet, and Congress. Enlightened and guided by Thy Spirit may they maintain and uphold the glorious principles of human liberty. Our hearts are filled with gratitude to Thee, our Father in heaven, for Thy kindness unto us in softening the hearts of our fellow citizens, the people of this nation, toward us. That which Thou hast done has been marvelous in our eyes. We thank Thee that Thou didst move upon the heart of the President of our nation to issue a general amnesty. Thou hast removed prejudice and misunderstanding from the minds of many of the people concerning us and our purposes, and they are disposed to treat us as fellow citizens, and not as enemies. In this holy house we feel to give Thee glory therefore, and we humbly ask Thee to increase this feeling in their hearts. Enable them to see us in our true light. Show unto them that we are their friends, that we love liberty, that we will join with them in upholding the rights of the people, the Constitution and laws of our country; and give unto us and our children an increased disposition to always be loyal, and to do everything in our power to maintain Constitutional rights and the freedom of all within the confines of this great Republic.</p><p>Remember in mercy, O Lord, the kings, the princes, the nobles the rulers, and governors and the great ones of the earth, and likewise all the poor, the afflicted and the oppressed, and indeed, all people, that their hearts may be softened when Thy servants go forth to bear testimony of Thy name, that their prejudices may give way before the truth, and Thy people find favor in their eyes. So control the affairs of the nations of the earth, that the way be prepared for the ushering in of a reign of righteousness and truth. We desire to see liberty spread throughout the earth, to see oppression cease, the yoke of the tyrant broken, and every despotic form of government overthrown by which Thy children are degraded and crushed, and prevented from enjoying their share of the blessings of the earth, which Thou hast created for their habitation.</p><p>O God, the Eternal Father, Thou knowest all things. Thou seest the course Thy people have been led to take in political matters. They have, in many instances, joined the two great national parties. Campaigns have been entered upon, elections have been held, and much party feeling has been engendered. Many things have been said and done which have wounded the feelings of the humble and the meek, and which have been a cause of offense. We beseech Thee, in Thine infinite mercy and goodness, to forgive Thy people wherein they have sinned in this direction. Show them, O Father, their faults and their errors, that they may see the same in the light of Thy Holy Spirit, and repent truly and sincerely, and cultivate that spirit of affection and love which Thou art desirous that all the children of men should entertain one for another, and which Thy Saints, above all others, should cherish. Enable Thy people hereafter to avoid bitterness and strife, and to refrain from words and acts in political discussions that shall create feeling and grieve Thy Holy Spirit.</p><p>Heavenly Father, when Thy people shall not have the opportunity of entering this holy house to offer their supplications unto Thee, and they are oppressed and in trouble, surrounded by difficulties or assailed by temptation and shall turn their faces towards this Thy holy house and ask Thee for deliverance, for help, for Thy power to be extended in their behalf, we beseech Thee, to look down from Thy holy habitation in mercy and tender compassion upon them, and listen to their cries. Or when the children of Thy people, in years to come, shall be separated, through any cause, from this place, and their hearts shall turn in remembrance of Thy promises to this holy Temple, and they shall cry unto Thee from the depths of their affliction and sorrow to extend relief and deliverance to them, we humbly entreat Thee to Turn Thine ear in mercy to them; hearken to their cries, and grant unto them the blessings for which they ask.</p><p>Almighty Father, increase within us the powers of that faith delivered to and possessed by Thy Saints. Strengthen us by the memories of the glorious deliverances of the past, by the remembrance of the sacred covenants that Thou hast made with us, so that, when evil overshadows us, when trouble encompasses us, when we pass through the valley of humiliation, we may not falter, may not doubt, but in the strength of Thy Holy name may accomplish all Thy righteous purposes with regard to us, fill the measure of our creation, and triumph gloriously, by Thy grace, over every besetting sin, be redeemed from every evil, and be numbered in the kingdom of heaven amongst those who shall dwell in Thy presence forever.</p><p>And now, our Father, we bless Thee, we praise Thee, we glorify Thee, we worship Thee, day by day we magnify Thee, and give Thee thanks for Thy great goodness towards us, Thy children, and we pray Thee, in the name of Thy Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, to hear these our humble petitions, and answer us from heaven, Thy holy dwelling place, where Thou sittest enthroned in glory, might, majesty, and dominion, and with an infinitude of power which we, Thy mortal creatures, cannot imagine, much less comprehend. Amen and Amen.</p>",

Please forgive us our trespasses as we totally repent, and let us earn and enjoy the rich blessings Thou has promised to the faithful.</p><p>Father, we are concerned with the condition of the world of today and that nations seem to need only the striking of a spark to bring war and desolation and destruction.  Bless, we pray Thee, the leaders of nations, that they may rule wisely and righteously, and give Thy people everywhere freedom to worship Thee.  Stay the powers, our Father, that would bring us to the brink of annihilation.</p><p>But insomuch as nations repent and follow Thee, be gracious, our Father, and let Thy destroying angel pass by, and let Thy people be forgiven.  Be merciful, O Lord, with Thy repentant ones when they have suffered and transformed their lives.</p><p>Our gracious Father, there are national gates which seemingly need to be unlocked and doors that need to be opened, and hearts of kings, presidents, emperors, and ministers which need to be softened, that they may permit the gospel to be taken to their people.  Let Thy Spirit rest mightily upon them, we pray Thee.</p><p>Our Father, bless the countless millions on the earth, that they may receive Thy truth, and bless the missionaries, now more than thirty thousand strong, that nothing will prevail against them in their faithful presentation of Thy gospel plan to the world.</p><p>Bless the poor and the needy of Thy people  Let not the cry of the widow and the orphan, the lonely and oppressed, go unheeded. Comfort those who mourn and give peace and blessed surcease to the sick and the afflicted.</p><p>We remember before Thee, our Father, the youth of Zion.  Bear them up that they shall not falter in defending truth and right. Help them to be clean and worthy and instill in them a desire for eternal marriage in Thy Holy Temple.</p><p>Our Beloved Father, bless the daughters of Zion, we pray Thee, O Lord.  Thou knowest our great love for them.  Pour out precious gifts of wisdom, faith and knowledge upon them.</p><p>Bless this temple that it may be a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of glory, a house of eternal marriage, a house of sealings, and Thy house, the House of God, wherein Thy holy saving work may be done for the salvation of both the living and the dead.</p><p>Bless, we pray Thee, the presidency of this temple and the matron and all the officiators herein.  Help them to create a sublime and holy atmosphere so that all ordinances may be performed with love and a sweet, spiritual tone that will cause the members to greatly desire to be here, and to return again and again.</p><p>Our Holy Father, we pray that Thou wilt bless this great nation, organized here in this choice land.  Bless the President of this nation, the Congress, the Justice Department, the cabinet, the lawmakers and the law enforcers in states, counties, and cities, that liberty and justice may continue to be the foundation stones of our existence.</p><p>And now, our Father, we ask Thee to accept this house, the workmanship of the hands of Thy servants, this house in which Thou canst dwell forever.</p><p>We pray Thee, Heavenly Father, to accept this building in all its parts, from the foundation stones to the highest spire, on which the statue of Moroni stands; we ask Thee to protect it, to sanctify it and consecrate it. </p><p>We pray Thee to bless the walls, partitions, floors, ceilings, roof, the elevators, stairways, doors, windows and other openings; all things connected with the lighting, heating, and sanitary facilities, and all articles used in or connected with the holy ordinances administered here.

May they blossom beautifully and be pleasant to all, that these grounds may be to all a haven of peace and rest and holy meditation.</p><p>Father, we beseech Thee to protect this building and all its appurtenances from harm or destruction by fire or flood, or the rage of the elements, shafts of lightning and blasts of hurricanes, the upheavals of earthquakes, and all disturbances of any nature.  Save it from any who, with evil design, would seek to desecrate its hallowed precincts.</p><p>And now, by the power of the Holy Priesthood Thou hast given us, we dedicate this building and all that pertains to it, together with all its furnishings and contents, to Thee, our Holy Father, and ask Thee to accept it and shower blessings upon it, in the worthy name of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.

    "seoul": "<p>O God our Eternal Father, Almighty Creator of heaven and earth, and Father of the inhabitants of all nations, we thank Thee for this day of dedication. We bow our heads before Thee in Thy holy house in reverent supplication. We come with love for Thee and Thy Son. We come in His holy name, even the name of the Redeemer of the world.</p><p>Our hearts are filled with gratitude for this long awaited day. This is the first such house of the Lord ever constructed on the mainland of Asia, this vast continent where dwell more than a billion of Thy sons and daughters, and where through the generations of the past have lived unnumbered hosts whose lives have not been touched by the saving principles of the gospel.</p><p>The seeds of Thy work were planted in Korea only a third of a century ago, when, amidst the thunders of war, a few of Thy faithful sons in military service exemplified the teachings of the gospel in their lives and shared them with a few of those they met. Then Thou didst touch the heart of a great and good scholar and leader, Kim Ho Jik, while he was studying in the United States. When he returned to his native land, having experienced the inspiration of the Book of Mormon, and having received a testimony of the prophetic call of Joseph Smith, he shared with others the beauty of his newly found treasure. Missionaries were invited to Korea, and here they taught with faith and inspiration, finding one soul here, another there.</p><p>From those times of small beginnings and serious privation Thy work has moved forward, its numbers have increased many fold, and it has prospered under Thy benevolent hand. Stakes of Zion have been established, and Thy Church, even the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has become firmly rooted in the soil of this beautiful land, and become the spiritual home of many thousands of good people in Korea.</p><p>Thou hast smiled with favor upon Thy work here. The government of this nation has been hospitable to Thy servants. Now, crowning all, is this beautiful edifice in which we meet and which we dedicate unto Thee.</p><p>We praise Thee, O God, for what has come to pass. We thank Thee for the expressions of Thy mighty power. We bless Thy name now and forever more.</p><p>As They servants, duly ordained and acting in the authority of the holy priesthood, and under delegation of responsibility from Thy chosen prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, we dedicate this, the Seoul Korea Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We dedicate it unto Thee, our Father and our God, and unto Thy Beloved Son, the Savior of all mankind. We dedicate it as Thy holy house, and pray that Thou, according to Thy will, might visit it and sanctify it with Thy holy presence.</p><p>We dedicate the building from the footings and foundation to the top of the tallest spire, including the figure of Moroni, the angel who brought another testament of the eternal gospel to be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. We dedicate all of its parts, facilities and furnishings, including the sacred altars at which eternal promises will be made. We dedicate the grounds, with all of their beauty, as an appropriate setting for this holy edifice.</p><p>May this, Thy house, be preserved from the effects of storm and tempest, from the tremblings of the earth, from the desecration of enemies, from the destructive forces of war and civil strife. May it ever be a house of peace, and a sanctuary from the noise and evil of the world. May the adversary of truth be barred from its portals, and may all who come here do so with clean hands and pure hearts, worthy to stand before Thee as Thy covenant children. May their numbers constantly increase, and may their faith strengthen. Wilt Thou encircle Thy strong protecting arm about them. May there be peace, love, and harmony in their homes. May their children grow in faith and loyalty to Thee.</p><p>May this be a house of sacred ordinances performed in the authority of the everlasting priesthood. May understanding of Thy divine purposes grow in the minds of all who are here instructed. May the covenants they make with Thee be engraven upon their hearts and the light of eternal truth be reflected from their countenances. May each come to recognize, in a new and remarkable way, not only the blessings that come of living the gospel in mortality, but of a continuation of these blessings in life beyond the veil of death. May the young men and young women, imbued with faith and testimony, here at these altars be joined in everlasting bonds of matrimony. May the covenants they here make one with another motivate them with a growing spirit of mutual appreciation and respect, husbands for wives and wives for husbands. May the understanding of eternal truth here received bring to them the knowledge that their children are also Thy children to be reared in love and nurtured in truth. May the children grow in faith and devotion to Thee that Thy work may become ever stronger in this and other nations of Asia.</p><p>Dear Father, bless this land and its people. May this nation remain free from bondage and servitude. Free the faithful saints from oppression and poverty. Bless them for their industry. May they be prospered as, in obedience to Thy divine law, they present unto Thee their tithes and offerings. Open the windows of heaven, and shower down blessings upon them.</p><p>Go before Thy faithful sons and daughters who serve as missionaries. Be on their right hand and on their left. Lead them to the honest in heart, and protect them from evil. Touch the minds of many by the enlightening power of the Spirit of Christ that they may hearken to the message of restored truths and be received into the fold of Thy work.</p><p>Wilt Thou smile upon the people of other nations of Asia. May they open their doors to Thy servants as has this nation of the Republic of Korea, that their people may also receive and be blessed by the truths of the everlasting gospel.</p><p>\"We thank Thee, O God, for a prophet.\" We have seen in recent days, with the passing of a great and good leader, the calling of another who has been prepared over a period of many years for the heavy responsibility that has fallen upon him. We have seen the quiet and wonderful transition of authority from one leader to another. We thank Thee for Thy servant, President Benson, and invoke Thy blessings upon him that he may find favor in Thy sight, that he may have strength and vitality to advance Thy work, and that he may be loved and honored by Thy people throughout the earth.</p><p>May all who are assembled in these dedicatory services be quick to heed the word of the Lord and follow the counsel of Thy divinely appointed servants. Bless them each one in his or her responsibility. Bless in a special way those who preside over the work in South Korea that they may act always with a Christ-like quality of love in their administrative undertakings.</p><p>Now Father, Thou art the great Elohim to whom we pray. Wilt Thou accept our thanks, and hear our pleas in behalf of Thy faithful saints. May Thy work grow and multiply in this land. May its influence for good be magnified wherever it is organized. May virtue mark the lives of the Latter-day Saints. Wilt Thou temper the elements and direct the environment in which they live for their blessing and happiness. Rebuke by Thy power those who fight against Zion.</p><p>Beloved Father in heaven, hear our prayer and grant us Thy blessings. Touch the heart of each that on this day there may be determination to walk more faithfully before Thee, with service to others as becomes those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ.</p><p>We thus pray, pledging anew our faith and service unto Thee in the name of our Redeemer, Thine Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>",

Father, we thank Thee for the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this the dispensation of the fulness of times. The everlasting priesthood, in all of its fulness, has been restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The keys of that priesthood are with Thy people and will be exercised in this holy house. The incomparable blessings flowing therefrom will be experienced not only by those in this life, but in the life beyond by Thy sons and daughters of all generations through living proxies acting in their behalf. All of the ordinances of Thy house, whether in behalf of the living or the dead, are eternal in their consequences.</p><p>We are thankful for those who laid the foundations of this and other nearby communities. They struggled so desperately for so long against adversities of many kinds. Now their posterity enjoy the sweet fruits of their efforts, and crowning all is this magnificent and beautiful temple.</p><p>We are grateful that this Thy house will be available to the sons and daughters of Lehi who live nearby. Let the scales of darkness fall from their eyes and bring a fulfillment of the ancient promises made concerning them. May this house become a hallowed sanctuary for many of these, our brothers and sisters.</p><p>And now, dear Father, as Thy servants acting in the authority of the holy priesthood which Thou hast bestowed upon us, and in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we dedicate and consecrate unto Thee and unto Him this the Snowflake Arizona Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Wilt Thou accept it as Thy holy house. We pray that Thou might see fit to visit it. Permit Thy Holy Spirit to be here at all times, its presence to be felt by all who labor here. May this house be ever sacred to those who enter it and to all who look upon it. May it truly be the House of the Lord, a place of holiness.</p><p>We dedicate and consecrate the structure itself and the grounds upon which it stands. We dedicate these beautiful surroundings adorned with Thy handiwork of grass, flowers, shrubs, and trees. We dedicate the footings and the foundation, the walls, the steeple, and the crowning figure of Moroni. We dedicate the interior of this Thy house, the Baptistry, the ordinance and instruction rooms, and the magnificent celestial room. We dedicate the sealing rooms with their sacred altars where the priesthood will be exercised to insure the eternal perpetuity of the family. We dedicate all other facilities which combined together constitute this sacred edifice.</p><p>O Father, please let Thy blessings rest upon this Thy house the erection of which has been made possible through the faithful contributors of tithes and offerings throughout the world.

We pray for the temple president and his counselors, for the matron and her assistants. May none weary in the beneficent work which they will perform.</p><p>Father, as we pray for those who will use this sacred building, we pray for Thy people throughout the earth. Let Thy blessings rest upon Thy faithful Saints wherever they may be. May each hold in his or her hand the torch of faith and be guided thereby in all circumstances. Open the heavens and pour down blessings upon those who live the ancient law of the tithe. Stay in their behalf the hand of the destroyer and multiply the fruits of their labors. We pray for those whom Thou hast called to lead Thy Church in this season of history. Make them equal to their great responsibilities and endow them with power from on high. Give them strength and energy and great capacity.</p><p>We pray for this nation of which we are part. In this time of national sorrow, bring peace and comfort to those who mourn. Preserve the freedom of the people. May the blessings of liberty rest upon its citizens. Bless those who lead and inspire them in their endeavors that righteousness may grow, that the people may look to Thee, and that this nation, under God, may continue as a base from which Thy work may spread throughout the earth.</p><p>Now, our beloved Father, how grateful we are for Thy precious Son; He who left Thy royal courts on high to come to earth, here to offer Himself as a sacrifice for the sins of all men. He is our great Redeemer, our Savior, and our Lord. As we love Thee, we love Him.</p><p>Almighty God, please smile with favor upon us. Forgive our weaknesses. Magnify our talents.

Give us, we pray, hearts of determination that we, thy people, may make such sacrifices as are necessary; that our sons may live righteously through their growing years and strive for spiritual excellence to be worthy to take the gospel to the nations of the world.</p><p>Our gracious Father, there are national gates which seemingly need to be unlocked and doors that need to be opened, and hearts of kings, presidents, emperors, and ministers which need to be softened, that they may permit the gospel to be taken to their people.</p><p>Our Father, bless the countless millions in the world, that they may receive thy truth, and bless the missionaries on whom the sun never sets, that nothing will prevail against them in their faithful presentation of thy gospel to the world, and bless especially, our Father, the children of thy people in overseas countries that they may devote their sons to this holy work. Wherein we have failed, help us to see our duties; wherein we have been prevented, open the doors, we pray, and swing the gates wide open and let thy servants cover the earth with their testimonies.</p><p>Our Almighty Father, increase our faith as we remember the glorious deliverances of the past. We remember that thy powerful hand did reveal thyself in the unconsumed \"burning bush\" in the desert. Thou didst reveal thy power in delivering the children of Israel from captivity in Egypt; thou didst deliver Noah and his posterity from the raging sea; thou didst lead the Lehite family across impossible deserts and uncrossable seas; thou didst protect Daniel in the lions\u2019 den; thou didst open prison doors and thou didst lead the modern Saints across the plains to the mountain valleys.</p><p>With these and numerous other events, we know that thou canst unlock gates and open doors, that we may present to the people of this world thy exalting program as thy Beloved Son has decreed. So we pray, lead our missionaries to all nations with their testimonies of the truth and successfully bridge all barriers.</p><p>Our Father in heaven, our hearts go out to the Lamanites. Give them listening ears and understanding hearts. Let them believe; cause that they may commune with thee and rid themselves of all \"other gods\" and superstitions and fears; let them grow mighty in thy cause. Bless them that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved.</p><p>Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless, we pray thee, thy leaders. We are grateful for all the presidents from Joseph Smith, Jr., to President Harold B. Lee, and thank thee for the rich contribution that each has made to thy cause. Bless, we pray thee, the incumbent president, and reveal thy mind and will to him and his counselors, that together they may give inspired leadership to thy program on the earth. Give to them wisdom, judgment, peace, protection, inspiration, and thy revelations continually. Likewise, we pray for the Twelve Apostles, that they may properly take the gospel to every soul of the earth. Give them thy holy revelations also. Bless the Patriarch to the Church, the Assistants to the Twelve, the First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric, the Regional Representatives of the Twelve, the stake and mission leaders, the wards and branches, the educational institutions, the auxiliaries, and all thy people in every area who give concerted action to bring growth and development to thy Church.</p><p>Bless, we pray thee, the presidency of this temple and the matron and all the officiators herein. Endow them with wisdom; help them create a holy atmosphere in this place so that all ordinances may be done with a sweet, spiritual tone that will cause the people to greatly desire to be here. Bless also the watchmen, the guards, and the officials who look after every part and portion of this edifice.</p><p>We are so grateful, our Father, that thy Son has thrown wide open the doors of the prisons for the multitudes who are waiting in the spirit world.</p><p>Wilt thou deign to make this temple thy house and let holy angels visit it to deliver thy messages, as the rushing of mighty winds with power and glory.</p><p>Holy Father, we are grateful that thou didst permit the appearance on the earth of Peter, James, and John to bring the Melchizedek Priesthood and the apostleship to thy servants, Joseph Smith and associates, and through them to us.</p><p>Our Holy Father, we have watched with great concern our brethren of Judah. We have seen their persecutions and torture and sufferings, and we pray that the hour may speedily come when they will believe the gospel, accept thy Son as their Savior, and be redeemed.</p><p>Bless the people who come into this building for their sealings, marriages, anointings, and other ordinances. Bless this place that it may be a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of glory, a house of eternal marriage, a house of sealings, and the house of God, even thy house, wherein the holy saving work may be done by the living for the countless dead.</p><p>Bless those who come here, that their hands may be holy as they lift them high, and that no unclean thing shall ever be permitted to come into this, thy house, to pollute it.</p><p>We ask thee, Holy Father, to confound and confuse and shame all who lie and spread false reports against thy servants, that all their destructive works may be brought to naught.</p><p>Our Holy Father. we pray that thou wilt bless this great nation, organized here on the choicest of all choice lands. Bless the President of this nation, the Congress, the Justice Department, the Cabinet, the lawmakers and the law enforcers in states, counties, and cities, that liberty may continue to be the foundation stone.</p><p>Our Holy Father, hear our pleadings; accept our penance; forgive our sins; and help us in our endeavors. Let thy blessings flow from thy heaven where thou sittest enthroned in glory, honor, power, majesty and might, dominion, truth and justice, judgment, mercy, and an infinity of fullness from everlasting to everlasting.</p><p>And now, our great and kind Father, accept this house, we pray. We dedicate it unto thee for thy holy and righteous purposes and put upon it thy name. Let us sing hosannahs to thee and the Lamb, and let these, thine anointed ones, be clothed in salvation, that thy Saints shall shout for joy.</p><p>And now, our Father, we ask thee to accept this house, the workmanship of the hands of thy servants, this house in which thou canst dwell forever.</p><p>We pray thee, Father, to accept this building in all its parts, from the foundation to the capstone and to all in between, and sanctify it and consecrate it.</p><p>From the lowest stone to the highest spire, on which the statue of Moroni stands, we ask thee to accept and protect.</p><p>Please bless these walls, that they decay not, and the partitions and floors and roof, the bridges, the elevators, and the stairways. Bless the lighting, the heating equipment, the boilers, the dynamos, the connecting pipes and wires, the lamps, the furniture, and articles of all kinds.</p><p>Bless also the veils, the altars, the curtains, the rugs, the baptismal font, and the oxen, the safes, the vaults, the record books, and the documents; bless all the furnishings, the seats, the cushions, the hangings, the locks, and all the appliances and appurtenances, including ornamentation, all work in wood and metal, the embroidery and needlework, the pictures and statuary, the silk, the wool, and the cotton;</p><p>The glass, the china, and all else herein, we humbly present for thine acceptance, thy sanctifying blessings, and thy protection.</p><p>Our Father, we present the altars before which thy servants and handmaidens will receive their blessings and sealings, and we pray that such may be kept holy.</p><p>With the buildings, we present the land on which they are built, the walks and fences and ornamental beds and trees and plants and flowers and shrubbery. May they blossom beautifully and be pleasant to all, that these hillsides may be a haven of peace and rest and holy meditation.</p><p>Father, we beg of thee to protect this building and appurtenances from injury and destruction by fire or flood or the rage of the elements, shafts of lightning and blasts of hurricanes, the upheaval of earthquakes, and all disturbing factors; O Lord, we beg of thee, protect it.</p><p>Now gracious Father, permit thy loyal, loving people to praise thy Holy Name forever in all nations with all kindreds and tongues and people, and let them cry with a loud voice before thy throne and before the Lamb of God, saying, \"Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb,\" and let us in unison \"praise thee, saying, Blessing and honor and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving, power and might be unto our God and His Son forever and ever.\"</p><p>And now, by the power of the holy priesthood thou hast given us, we dedicate this building and all that is connected therewith and all its furnishings and contents to thee, our Holy Father, and ask thy blessings upon it. In the worthy name of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen and Amen and Amen.</p>",

    "winterquarters": "<p>O God our Eternal Father, Thou Great Elohim, we bow before Thee in humility and with gratitude to dedicate this Thy holy house. The ground on which this sacred structure stands was hallowed a century and a half ago by the suffering of Thy Saints. Here they stopped temporarily, hundreds and thousands of them on both sides of the Missouri River, while moving westward from their homes in Nauvoo, or from the British Isles and Europe to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Many of them died here and are buried in the cemetery adjacent to this holy house. Great were their trials. Tremendous their sacrifice.</p><p>As we meet together, we envision the wagons and the boats pulling in from the East and the South, while others were leaving these grounds to make the long march up the Elk Horn, along the waters of the Platte, up the valley of the Sweet Water, over the Continental Divide, and finally to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. All of this area, including Council Bluffs across the river and Florence on this side, was once a place of great industry. Here wagons and handcarts were built. Here oxen, cows, and other animals, seeds and plants were gathered together to move to the West. There was, at times, much of levity here. There was also much of sorrow.</p><p>Now the generations have come and gone. Our people left here. Then for reasons of employment they slowly returned. Today we have stakes and wards with large congregations. Songs of thanksgiving fill our hearts. Crowning all is the presence of a temple on this hallowed ground.</p><p>Acting in the authority of the holy priesthood in us vested and in the name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate this the Winter Quarters Nebraska Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We dedicate it unto Thee and unto Thy Son as Thy holy house for the accomplishment of Thy work. We dedicate the ground on which it stands, ground which has already been made holy by those who long ago were buried here. We make the cemetery a part of these grounds, together with all of the vegetation growing thereon. We dedicate the temple from the footings to the top of the steeple with its figure of Moroni.</p><p>We dedicate the walls and roof and pray that they may be strong and firm against the storms of nature.</p><p>We dedicate the interior of the building, the beautiful baptistry, the endowment rooms, the Celestial Room, and the sealing rooms with their sacred altars. We dedicate all of the halls and spaces and offices within this sacred structure. We pray that Thou wilt accept of them and that Thou wilt visit them with Thy holy presence. Let Thy Spirit dwell here and touch the hearts of all who enter these portals. Save this building from the hands of any disposed to mar or destroy. May it stand through the years as a place of holiness, a house sanctified unto Thee, a place of eternal ordinances.</p><p>We pray for all who will serve here, whether they be workers or patrons. May the hearts of all who live within this temple district turn to this sacred structure. May Thy people so live as to be worthy to labor here. We pray for those who will serve in the presidency of the temple and those in the office of matron and assistants to the matron. We pray for all who serve here in any capacity and ask that Thou wilt touch the hearts of Thy people with a great desire to come frequently to Thy holy house.</p><p>We thank Thee for faithful tithe payers throughout the world, whose contributions have made possible the construction of this and the many other temples now enjoyed by Thy people. Pour out Thy blessings upon the faithful Latter-day Saints wherever they may be. May blessings come down from heaven upon them. May their lives be enriched. May they be prospered in their affairs. May they be cradled in Thy strong arms as they walk in faith before Thee.</p><p>We thank Thee for the Prophet Joseph Smith to whom the temple ordinances were revealed. Let Thy blessings rest upon the Presidency of Thy Church, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric, and all who serve in any capacity whatever throughout the world.</p><p>Bless the officials of the City of Omaha, who have worked cooperatively with us in this sacred undertaking. Bless all of the citizens of the States of Nebraska and Iowa. Bless this nation of which we are a part that it shall remain ever free and that its people may always be blessed with liberty to worship according to the dictates of conscience.</p><p>Dear Father, accept of our thanks for every blessing. On this sacred and historic day, we resolve within our hearts to serve Thee with greater dedication. We ask it as Thy humble children with thanksgiving and gratitude in the name of Thy Beloved Son, even the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, amen.</p>"
